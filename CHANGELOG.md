    These represent the leylines, ogham stones, cruxes, and all other symbolic or magically connected places across the world.
    These locations passively affect the Doom Counter and should tie into players mid/long term goals
    For now only the core regions of the Old World have been implemented as well as some of the Wastes as we work to dial in the math and the performance impact of locations
    There are several stages for places of power: Active, Inactive, Corrupt, Drained
    > Active places of power drain points directly from the doom counter
    > Inactive places of power have no effect
    > Corrupt places of power contribute points directly to the doom counter
    > Drained places of power have been rendered temporarily inactive for an alternative effect
    Places of power can be corrupted or restored as long as you meet several qualifications and the location is under your control
    For now the ability to drain them has been disabled until the next round of events are added and we add the Lizardmen Places of Power

- Made some fixes to the chess with death event

  > Cons:
  - Lose the unique names on most mountain ranges etc.
  - Terrain is greyed out in realm view mode (most used mode) so less pretty
  - Surrounding the provinces in question will no longer fill it in your color so minor addition to border gore in large regional empires
  > Pros:
  - Legibility, at a glance players have the important information on movement paths and bottlenecks
  - AI, we have strongly suspected its at least somewhat to cause for ai breakdowns while impassable terrain is a hardcoded pathfinding calculation
  - Legibility, the large names across big swathes of land could easily get in the way (think the giant chaos wastes word across the top)
  - Legibility/bug fix, this removes the floating letters on the map as the skaven tunnels name stretched across the old world funny and ended up jumbled
  - Since each one uses a province to define it, removing them frees up something like 50 provinces for use anywhere you want

- Added Generic Druchii artifacts
- Fix to Drakenhof starting with a city as the capital and fixed the drakenhof unique buildings

- Disinherited Neferatas and Ushorans brother and his children so if they die we dont end up with a random tomb king in the badlands/mountains

- Merged Malekith death and overthrown empire destruction event. Now when Malekith loses his empire or dies e_naggaroth is destroyed
- If Malekith held e_ulthuan as well and the the heir to e_naggaroth gets both empires and is not in the asur_group then e_ulthuan is destroyed as well

- First wonder in the Chaos wastes, the Inevitable City, notably give big population max and pop growth to chaos nomads along with other minor boosts, no custom upgrades right now
- Added chaos cult sleeper agents:
    The ai can attempt to recruit even when the society has reached the max membership limit, if they succeed in the event chain the recruited target will not join the full society
    and instead simply change secret religion and be flagged a sleeper agent
    Every 5 years the sleeper agents will check if the society has dipped in membership below the limit and join automatically if it has, when a general cultist uprising happens
    any sleeper agents will convert, leave any non chaos societies and join in alongside the normal society members
    People the player recruit will always join the society bypassing the limit same as before.
    rank 3 members of the cult can now also declare an uprising, as the cults are global and members in realms other than the single rank 4 member were essentially useless
    the ai will not currently declare an uprising if the player is in the same realm as a rank 3 or 4 member
