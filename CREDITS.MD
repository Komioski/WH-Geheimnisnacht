  [^^ Due to a dev non-integration policy the original work was only used for visual inspiration and code guidance all work was recreated from scratch ^^]
-----
  - Still working on contributing them all but inspiration and code examples from many places were used in the creation of this work.
    Development has spanned a decade and it will not be possible to know where every line of code originated.
    So in general thank you to the entire Paradox modding community for all of the help and information.
    This couldn't have happened without all of you.
