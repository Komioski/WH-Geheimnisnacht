 Known Bugs / Balance Issues
------------------------------------------------------
- Bugs from Warhammer 1.2 are to be expected
- Events are not optimized.
- Decision are not optimized
- Cults/Societies are not optimized
- Dwarf holdings not optimized. (assault/siege/attrition)
- Ork size unbalanced. Too fast from small to huge Orc from battles
- The player can elect anybody as the Emperor of the Empire (I suspect something in scripted_triggers)
- Bloodlines not finished
- Magic System is broken (You can use basic magic. raising undead and summing demons from prisoners.)
- Skaven cannot assign an education focus
- the Grail and knightly quests are merged into one line until they can be expanded
- Cathay as our first offmap power (replacing vanilla china) is roughshod and incomplete
- Severly limiting diplomatic range of cathay failed (they should only be interacting with araby/ulthuan world_regions)
    I suspect "cathay_diplo_interaction_trigger" in scripted_triggers and "diplomatic_range" in offmap_cathay
- Recruit Physician bugged. Nothing happens when you recruit them
- Holy fury events need to be Optimized (Localization) exa ( HF.24006)
- cold_one_mount icon is missing in treasury
- Clicking on the mini-map does nothing
- tzeentch sacrifice doesn't kill prisoners.
- For some reason the game thinks that c_calxi (10740 calixi)  city on the coast is in a desert. Province is not a desert.
- Elven courting may have several issues
- Bretonnian Questing event options need descriptions beyond "no effect" its misleading
- Vassalizing holy order makes you lose the decision to donate/borrow money from them
- Skaven trade post buildings broken/nonexistant (esp. when conquering the dwarven underway)
- The event for seduction target being too old makes no sense when it activates for/against vampires.
------------------------------------------------------
More info/testing
------------------------------------------------------
- Cannot turn my temple vassal into a vampire
- Pressing claims on kingdoms (Playing as Empire) Doesnt fully destroy false empires and doesnt fully conquer them.
- Maletkih isn't incapacitated after losing a duel. He goes on as of nothing happened. This also happens when you "kill" Malektih in a plot.
- nomination for High kingdom of Norsca, which doesnt exist
- Mists of albion may now be permeable by some CBs, this is unintentional
- Old Gods Blot Events
- Smith Events May need to be updated/repaired

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------
```
Q: Are you going to add anything from the Age of Sigmar/The End Times?
A: Short answer: No. I have plenty of work overhauling the current bookmark for now.
```
```
Q: Why can't I play a Half-Elf/Half-Dwarf/Half-Orc/other hybrid character?
A: Because they don't exist in Warhammer. Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs, Lizardmen etc. are not biologically compatible. If you take an Elf/Dwarf/etc. as a lover or concubine, any pregnancies will only result in stillbirths, and that's only because the game engine won't let us completely prevent interbreeding.
```
```
Q: I'm having trouble with the Ruler Designer!
A: The Ruler Designer is not explicitly supported for Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht. We've done some work to fix its worst problems but it is still unbalanced and incomplete. Use at your own risk.
```
```
Q: I understand you don't support the Ruler Designer, but how do I get around the problems?
A: Use the admin console to add your race trait if it doesn't appear after a few months of in-game time. This can help you avert several issues like the marriage, divorce and miscarriage bug, the lack of long life as an elf or dwarf, the lack of immortality as a vampire or Tomb King, and so on. Most of the time when we get a report of an issue with the Ruler Designer, it's because of race trait issues. Don't add your race trait in the RD itself - due to a hardcoded issue, it causes some traits (like any with the Immortal tag) to not function properly.
```
```
Q: What DLCs do I need to play this mod?
A: You can play Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht with nothing but the most barebones basic version of Crusader Kings 2 with absolutely none of the DLC activated except for Charlemagne which is required for our 3-D models. However, all major DLCs are highly recommended, as they are either needed for race mechanics or to fully enhance the experience. Most importantly: Horse Lords - Many races, such as Blood Dragon Vampires and High Elfs use HL mechanics Legacy of Rome - Many powerful retinues that balance certain races are contained here The Republic - There are many different merchant republics scattered across the globe The Old Gods - Norse flavour and events for the Norscans and Kislevite pagans Jade Dragon - off-map Powers for Cathay and the Chaos Gods Holy Fury - Bloodlines, warrior lodges and More! No music, unit, or portrait packs are needed, as Geheimnisnacht uses its own music composed by Steve Gernes, custom 3-D models, and handmade portraits made by Silfae.
```
```
Q: How do I learn/use magic?
A: The Magic system is one of the big systems in need of a rebuild. In its current state, I'm not sure what works and what doesn't. Hopefully, I can finish it soon.
```
```
Q: Why can't Khornates or Blood Dragons learn magic?
A: Lore restriction, Khornates and Blood Dragons do not use or learn magic under any circumstances. This also means that it **won't** be implemented. Sorry, that's just how the lore works.
```
```
Q: Why is the Empire not unified?
A: Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht begins in IC 2010, over five centuries before the reign of Karl Franz and the familiar events of recent Warhammer canon such as Total War: Warhammer, the Storm of Chaos campaign, the End Times, etc. Three centuries before Magnus the Pious reunited the Empire in 2304 the Empire was in a state of civil war, as multiple Electors fought over the Imperial throne - and on the night of Geheimnisnacht in 2010, the day the mod begins, Vlad von Carstein of Sylvania revealed himself as a vampire and threw his hat into the ring by summoning a great undead host. This date was chosen because the divisions and events taking place at the time made for better gameplay than the more unified and - so to speak - more stable Warhammer world of the 2500s. Imagine trying to play a campaign when almost every faction is one giant blob!
```
```
Q: Are you going to expand the map to Cathay?
A: Short answer: No. Long answer: Very little information exists on Cathay, Ind, Nippon and the rest of the lands beyond the Mountains of Mourn in the Warhammer setting. We have nothing to work with, no idea how to properly put their factions together, what mechanics to give them, nothing. Not to mention that the game is already rather laggy with the current world map - expanding the map further and adding at least three new major kingdoms, not to mention all the other factions we'd have to put in, would likely make Geheimnisnacht unplayable on all but the strongest computers. We have, however, compromised and added some Cathayans to a colony in the Southlands. And with Jade Dragon introducing off-map powers we have begun work on representing Cathay in some way.
```
```
Q: Is there any End Times-style content? Like the world ending?
A: Something to that effect is planned, absolutely, but not yet fully implemented.
```
```
Q: I got killed by a Halfling in a minor skirmish!
A: Such is life in CK2, consider hiding in your keep if you're afraid of death.
```
```
Q: I want to help out! How can I join the Geheimnisnacht team?
A: It's as easy as making something we can implement into the mod! Put together an event, some code, a guide, etc. and contact @Komioski, the current developer, or ping him in #general-discussion. If your content works, fits the setting and lore and doesn't possess our computers with daemons from the Chaos Realm, you will likely be recruited to the team! ...If it breaks everything, melts our PCs, overpowers the game or contains Warcraft references, you will likely not be recruited to the team. Please test your work before sending it to us, exorcising our offices and computers and replacing devoured team members can seriously delay work on updates.
```
```
Q: Is this mod dead? Why haven't I heard any news in a while?
A: Be Patient, I have a Development Plan/Roadmap, and I'm constantly active if you haven't heard anything it means I'm working hard on the next update! Trust me, you'll be informed if we ever stop development.
```
```
Q: Are there any plans to create a mod for CK3?
A: Yes we plan to look into the viability of such a thing upon release in September, we will let you know when we have something to share.
```
```
Q: How do I become a tester/Lab Rat? What's the point?
A: Anyone who meets the requirements (over 100hrs of playtime, all DLCs, and lore knowledge) can join the lab rat program. We recruit in waves and the #admissions channel opens with little warning but if you manage to make it in it can be a lot of fun! Perks include exclusive sub-mods, access to Dev versions, multiplayer games with the Dev, and a chance to earn a seat on the Council of Thirteen. An exclusive group of contributors with some power over development.
```
```
Q: Does this mod accept donations or have a Patreon?
A: Nothing official at the moment, I have a Patreon for my game development projects but it's not linked to this project at this time. Perhaps in the future.
```
```
Q: What is WH: Geheimnisnacht - Legacy?
A: With the recent worldwide pandemic this year, development was put on hiatus for a few months as I adjusted to working from home. This meant that my initial planned release window of summer for the main branch of the mod would have to be pushed back, making it more than 2 years since a public version has been made available to the community. Therefore I decided to set aside some time to rework a personal project of one of our Lab Rats @manuswag, which compiled the old 1.2 version of Geheimnisnacht with my current development version into a "playable" (it didn't CTD at least) version of the mod compatible with CK2 v3.3.3. I spent a week recruiting a host of new Lab Rats and put them to work rooting out the most obvious/game-breaking bugs most of which I managed to fix. The released version is Technically Unsupported and may or may not receive future development (though there is a #critical-bug-report channel for any game-breaking bugs). Eventually, it will be made obsolete by the release of the main branch whenever it may be ready. Until Then Enjoy!
