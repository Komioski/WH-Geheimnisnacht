                  README/ROADMAP

------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS A DARK age, a bloody age, an age of daemons
and of sorcery. It is an age of battle and death.
and of the world’s ending. Amidst all of the fire,
flame and fury it is a time, too, of mighty heroes,
of bold deeds and great courage.
    ~         ~
AT THE HEART of the Old World sprawls the Empire,
the largest and most powerful of the human realms.
Known for its engineers, sorcerers, traders and
soldiers, it is a land of great mountains, mighty
rivers, dark forests and vast cities. It is a land
riven by uncertainty, as three pretenders all vye
for control of the Imperial throne.
    ~         ~
BUT THESE ARE far from civilized times.
Across the length and breadth of the Old World,
from the knightly palaces of Bretonnia to ice-bound
Kislev in the far north, come rumblings of war.
In the towering Worlds Edge Mountains, the orc
tribes are gathering for another assault.
Bandits and renegades harry the wild southern lands
of the Border Princes. There are rumours of
rat-things, the Skaven, emerging from the sewers
and swamps across the land. And from the northern
wildernesses there is the ever-present threat of
Chaos, of Daemons and Beastmen corrupted by
the foul powers of the Dark Gods.
As the time of battle draws ever near,
the Empire needs heroes like never before.

WH: Geheimnisnacht | Roadmap to 2.0
------------------------------------------------------
>   The plan is to completely refactor and document the entire codebase, at the same time, a merging program is used to check that our files which
| are often based on older versions of vanilla CK2 are now in fact based on the current version of those same files.
| Many of the files are up to date, but Events and Decisions as well as a few other files have been left behind and are in a sorry state.
| Additionally Much of the original GFX is beginning to show its age and adds a considerable weight to the system
| Therefore detailed below are the general requirements of a v2.0 release and how to get there.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------
```
Q: Are you going to add anything from the Age of Sigmar/The End Times?
A: Short answer: No. I have plenty of work overhauling the current bookmark for now.
```
```
Q: Why can't I play a Half-Elf/Half-Dwarf/Half-Orc/other hybrid character?
A: Because they don't exist in Warhammer. Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs, Lizardmen etc. are not biologically compatible. If you take an Elf/Dwarf/etc. as a lover or concubine, any pregnancies will only result in stillbirths, and that's only because the game engine won't let us completely prevent interbreeding.
```
```
Q: I'm having trouble with the Ruler Designer!
A: The Ruler Designer is not explicitly supported for Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht. We've done some work to fix its worst problems but it is still unbalanced and incomplete. Use at your own risk.
```
```
Q: I understand you don't support the Ruler Designer, but how do I get around the problems?
A: Use the admin console to add your race trait if it doesn't appear after a few months of in-game time. This can help you avert several issues like the marriage, divorce and miscarriage bug, the lack of long life as an elf or dwarf, the lack of immortality as a vampire or Tomb King, and so on. Most of the time when we get a report of an issue with the Ruler Designer, it's because of race trait issues. Don't add your race trait in the RD itself - due to a hardcoded issue, it causes some traits (like any with the Immortal tag) to not function properly.
```
```
Q: What DLCs do I need to play this mod?
A: You can play Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht with nothing but the most barebones basic version of Crusader Kings 2 with absolutely none of the DLC activated except for Charlemagne which is required for our 3-D models. However, all major DLCs are highly recommended, as they are either needed for race mechanics or to fully enhance the experience. Most importantly: Horse Lords - Many races, such as Blood Dragon Vampires and High Elfs use HL mechanics Legacy of Rome - Many powerful retinues that balance certain races are contained here The Republic - There are many different merchant republics scattered across the globe The Old Gods - Norse flavour and events for the Norscans and Kislevite pagans Jade Dragon - off-map Powers for Cathay and the Chaos Gods Holy Fury - Bloodlines, warrior lodges and More! No music, unit, or portrait packs are needed, as Geheimnisnacht uses its own music composed by Steve Gernes, custom 3-D models, and handmade portraits made by Silfae.
```
```
Q: How do I learn/use magic?
A: The Magic system is one of the big systems in need of a rebuild. In its current state, I'm not sure what works and what doesn't. Hopefully, I can finish it soon.
```
```
Q: Why can't Khornates or Blood Dragons learn magic?
A: Lore restriction, Khornates and Blood Dragons do not use or learn magic under any circumstances. This also means that it **won't** be implemented. Sorry, that's just how the lore works.
```
```
Q: Why is the Empire not unified?
A: Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht begins in IC 2010, over five centuries before the reign of Karl Franz and the familiar events of recent Warhammer canon such as Total War: Warhammer, the Storm of Chaos campaign, the End Times, etc. Three centuries before Magnus the Pious reunited the Empire in 2304 the Empire was in a state of civil war, as multiple Electors fought over the Imperial throne - and on the night of Geheimnisnacht in 2010, the day the mod begins, Vlad von Carstein of Sylvania revealed himself as a vampire and threw his hat into the ring by summoning a great undead host. This date was chosen because the divisions and events taking place at the time made for better gameplay than the more unified and - so to speak - more stable Warhammer world of the 2500s. Imagine trying to play a campaign when almost every faction is one giant blob!
```
```
Q: Are you going to expand the map to Cathay?
A: Short answer: No. Long answer: Very little information exists on Cathay, Ind, Nippon and the rest of the lands beyond the Mountains of Mourn in the Warhammer setting. We have nothing to work with, no idea how to properly put their factions together, what mechanics to give them, nothing. Not to mention that the game is already rather laggy with the current world map - expanding the map further and adding at least three new major kingdoms, not to mention all the other factions we'd have to put in, would likely make Geheimnisnacht unplayable on all but the strongest computers. We have, however, compromised and added some Cathayans to a colony in the Southlands. And with Jade Dragon introducing off-map powers we have begun work on representing Cathay in some way.
```
```
Q: Is there any End Times-style content? Like the world ending?
A: Something to that effect is planned, absolutely, but not yet fully implemented.
```
```
Q: I got killed by a Halfling in a minor skirmish!
A: Such is life in CK2, consider hiding in your keep if you're afraid of death.
```
```
Q: I want to help out! How can I join the Geheimnisnacht team?
A: It's as easy as making something we can implement into the mod! Put together an event, some code, a guide, etc. and contact @Komioski, the current developer, or ping him in #general-discussion. If your content works, fits the setting and lore and doesn't possess our computers with daemons from the Chaos Realm, you will likely be recruited to the team! ...If it breaks everything, melts our PCs, overpowers the game or contains Warcraft references, you will likely not be recruited to the team. Please test your work before sending it to us, exorcising our offices and computers and replacing devoured team members can seriously delay work on updates.
```
```
Q: Is this mod dead? Why haven't I heard any news in a while?
A: Be Patient, I have a Development Plan/Roadmap, and I'm constantly active if you haven't heard anything it means I'm working hard on the next update! Trust me, you'll be informed if we ever stop development.
```
```
Q: Are there any plans to create a mod for CK3?
A: Yes we plan to look into the viability of such a thing upon release in September, we will let you know when we have something to share.
```
```
Q: How do I become a tester/Lab Rat? What's the point?
A: Anyone who meets the requirements (over 100hrs of playtime, all DLCs, and lore knowledge) can join the lab rat program. We recruit in waves and the #admissions channel opens with little warning but if you manage to make it in it can be a lot of fun! Perks include exclusive sub-mods, access to Dev versions, multiplayer games with the Dev, and a chance to earn a seat on the Council of Thirteen. An exclusive group of contributors with some power over development.
```
```
Q: Does this mod accept donations or have a Patreon?
A: Nothing official at the moment, I have a Patreon for my game development projects but it's not linked to this project at this time. Perhaps in the future.
```
```
Q: What is WH: Geheimnisnacht - Legacy?
A: With the recent worldwide pandemic this year, development was put on hiatus for a few months as I adjusted to working from home. This meant that my initial planned release window of summer for the main branch of the mod would have to be pushed back, making it more than 2 years since a public version has been made available to the community. Therefore I decided to set aside some time to rework a personal project of one of our Lab Rats @manuswag, which compiled the old 1.2 version of Geheimnisnacht with my current development version into a "playable" (it didn't CTD at least) version of the mod compatible with CK2 v3.3.3. I spent a week recruiting a host of new Lab Rats and put them to work rooting out the most obvious/game-breaking bugs most of which I managed to fix. The released version is Technically Unsupported and may or may not receive future development (though there is a #critical-bug-report channel for any game-breaking bugs). Eventually, it will be made obsolete by the release of the main branch whenever it may be ready. Until Then Enjoy!

- More ogre mercs for everyone
- How about an option to clear out Fimir presence just like you can do with Beastmen and Greenskins?
- Also disable the getting into shape war focus line For ogres And possibly the "you're eating too much" ones or reflavor the events to tell you to eat more

- Decision for a Fimir ruler who holds the de jure Kingdom of Westerlands to become Chaos Court and gain some kind of bloodline/flavor event, based on the Old Lore that the Westerlands
- An artifact stealing system similiar to elder kings
- I would love to claim the high kingship as an southern dwarf. It is locked to dwarf_main and dwarf_grey at the moment. If dwarf_southron generally should not be able to claim it maybe it could be possible to convert to dwarf_main if you rebuild Karak Eightpeaks
- Bloodlines for refounding Solland and the Drakwald
- How about using unused models from vanilla ck2 and place them where such might fit? Like the Varangian guard models for example.
- Dwarves in spine of sotek, and an actual heraldry for the rulling house in Sudenburg please
- Maybe flesh out Khaardun the gloried a bit more? Since theyre supposed to be the 11th everchosen. I meant that he doesnt have the Everchosen trait. Maybe an event that is him finally blowing up?
- Event explaining dark crystal
- Temple main holding gov for jade vamps and cathayans
- Gnomes from faerun mod?
- Some sort of CB to attack rulers who refuse to be investigated or banish the Witch hunters. A CB that results in the death of the ruler in question I think would be appropriate.
- Also when investigating it sends an AI society member to do it instead of going yourself, can we have an option to go ourselves so we can investigate and make decisions?
