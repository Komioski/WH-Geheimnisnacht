#	Artifacts are a free part of patch 2.7 and don't actually require the Monks and Mystics expansion
# though most vanilla artifacts are part of the expansion they allow classical-RPG concepts of treasury (stash) and equipment slots (inventory)

Transfer
random_artifact = {
	artifact_type = xxx
	transfer_artifact = {

	}
}

quality	> int	>	quality = 2

flags >	List<string> >	Flags that can be checked with has_artifact_flag condition.	EX: flags = { chest hermetics very_rare }

active >	Character conditions >	Conditions for the artifact to be usable by a character. EX: See is_artifact_active condition.

An artifact with an active trigger but without owner will never be considered active
An artifact without an active trigger will always be considered active, even if not owned.

ROOT is the owner and FROM is the artifact

active = {
  is_adult = yes
}

allowed_gift >	Character conditions	> Conditions for the trigger artifact_can_be_gifted_to.

stacking >	bool >	If no, can only have a single copy of this artifact in one's possession. Defaults to "yes".	EX: stacking = no

indestructible >	bool >	Whether destroy_artifact has any affect. Defaults to "no". EX: indestructible = yes

picture	> gfx >	Defines the gfx name, typically GFX_<artifact_name> EX: picture = "GFX_strange_chest"

2 images are needed:

118x118px for GFX_<artifact_name>
59x59px for GFX_<artifact_name>_small

<modifier> >	Character modifiers >	Modifiers given by the artifact when it is equipped.
	EXAMPLE:
		martial = 2
		monthly_character_piety = -2
		tech_growth_modifier = 0.05
		combat_rating = 2

slot >	string >	Associated slot to equip the artifact. New slots can be added dynamically. EX:	slot = crown

Localization:

<artifact_name>: name of the artifact
<artifact_name>_desc: description of the arftifact
<slot>: name of the equipment slot

Pictures:

The pictures are set in C:\Users\Your user name\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\gfx\interface\inventory\artifacts
Example for mods: C:\Users\Your user name\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod\WH-Geheimnisnacht\gfx\interface\inventory\artifacts

The link between the GFX code and the picture is in Vanilla file interface/domestic_treasury.gfx
You can use artifact backgrounds (arti_bg.dds, arti_bg_glow.dds, arti_bg_small.dds, and arti_bg_glow_small.dds)
in gfx/interface/inventory/artifacts to make artifacts that follow the style of the vanilla artifacts

Slots:

Artifacts can be equipped or unequipped. Number of equipped artifacts are limited by dynamic "slots":

# The limiting slots for equipped artifacts. Dynamic system (you can add new types of slots freely)

## mount
	Some mounts will also get a combat rating matching the artifact tier alternatively they may get days_of_supply for pack animals. Very rarely a mount will get buffs/changes to stats to match lore or for balance

	Mounts:

	AI mount re-calculation:
		This code snippet is used in the active = {} block for mount artifacts, it forces the AI to recalc the best mount in the treasury since AI dont change artifacts otherwise once equipped

			hidden_tooltip = {
				OR = {
					ai = no
					NOT = { has_character_flag = ai_recalc_equipped_mount }
				}
			}
