***From prison***
-People you imprisoned can become your new host.
***From duels***
-When you win a personal duel you have an options to take the losers body, spare him or kill him
-When you lose a duel you have an option to duel again for the opponents body (Making you unkillable at first try, **losing the second duel will get you killed**), or you can retreat.
                     -After you lose the first round, the "body decay" traits are removed and trait "no body" is given, so you would gain the full PSC (Lore based)

***Notes***
-Taking opponents body kills him
-Duels with enemy commanders while leading an army also count!

(part 2)

**Body decay**
Since being a bloated corpse follower of Nurgle, your shell of a body will always decay til it fully crumbles off around you.
Getting a new body removes the "No body trait" and immidietly gives you "decay (0) trait".
Every few years this trait counts up (0>1>2>3>"no body trait").
**Taking a new body while having one already, resets the "decay # trait" to "decay 0 trait"**
Higher the decay, faster the body decays

Decay 0 (2-10 years)
-  +0.1 prestige
-  +0.1 piety
-  -25 PSC
-  +5 same religion opinion (Nurgle)
Decay 1 (2-5 years)
-  +0.5 prestige
-  +0.5 piety
-  -50 PSC
-  +10 same religion opinion (Nurgle)
Decay 2 (1-5 years)
-  +1 prestige
-  +1 piety
-  -100 PSC
-  +25 same religion opinion (Nurgle)
Decay 3 (0.5-2 years)
-  +2 prestige
-  +2 piety
-  -200 PSC
-  +50 same religion opinion (Nurgle)
(Body will fully decay and the decay trait will be replaced by "no body trait". 

**Losing/removing/changing your body**
1. Decision to leave body in search of new one (prisinors or duels)
2. Body fully decaying after "Decay 3 trait" forcing you to leave it (losing "dcay 3 trait" and gaining "no body trait")
3. Winning/losing duels

**Portrait gfx**
Having "no body trait" puts the maggotlord base portrait.
Now it would be amazing if when taking over a new body, that persons portrait can be transfered to the maggot lords one, replacing the maggotlord base til losing that body.
OR
Anytime you have "Body decay # trait" the portrait gfx is of the nurgle deamon prince gfx

**Maggot lord ascending**
Bonus/easier on getting/ascending to champion, chosen and deamon prince.
**Ascending to deamonhood gives you a decision to settle into a body permamently, removing "no body trait" and "body decay #" traits permamently, letting you keep the "maggot lord trait"**
