Mentheus, right hand of Morvael the Impetuous, wielded it until his death upon the walls of Anlec, having spilled more Dark Elf blood than any other since the time of Tethlis the Slayer. An ordinary blade would be dulled by such a roster of endless war, but this sword has never lost its edge. To the valiant, it lends supernatural speed and vigour but to the craven and corrupt, it brings only swift death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_reaver_bow;The Reaver Bow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_reaver_bow_desc;Imollar was a noble of Ellyrion, and a marksman of considerable note. It was said his arrows could fly true through stormy winds and still find their mark, even if he took but a moment to aim. Upon hearing this, Arathion, himself a skilled archer - and one burdened by a surfeit of pride - challenged Imollar, a fellow noble of Ellyrion, to an archery contest, staking as a prize the Reaver Bow. So it was nobles from across Ulthuan bore witness to a contest not seen again for generations. As the final arrow found its mark, Imollar was crowned as the greatest archer of all, and Arathion discovered humility - along with the folly of staking his family's treasured heirlooms as wagers in a contest of pride;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_shadow_armour;Shadow Armour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_shadow_armour_desc;The Shadow Armour was crafted with skills now lost to the High Elves. Some believe it was forged in the hidden camps of Shadow Warriors, whilst others hint it is not Elf make at all, but a gift from Loec, the trickster god. The shimmering armour weighs almost nothing and exist somewhere between the real world and that of magic, allowing its wearer to pass all but unseen by mortal eyes. First to don it was Prince Telmakador, one of the handful of nobles who saw Aethis' reign for the folly it was and fought a bitter campaign of ambush and sabotage against the Dark Elves as the Phoenix Court descended into complacency. Many times did Aethis' agents seek Telmakador's arrest, but each time he was thought cornered, he melded into the darkness and slipped away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_merwyrm_shield;Shield of the Merwyrm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_merwyrm_shield_desc;In the murky deeps far below Lothern's Emerald Gate slumbers Amanar, ancient protector of the city. Only in hours of greatest need does the merwyrm rouse and rise to the surface to consume those who would bring about Lothern's ruin. The records kept in the Glittering Tower tell that Amanar has manifested but three times in recorded history. The first was during the Daemon invasion, where he swallowed a whole legion that laid siege to the city. The second came during the Sundering, where his broad back held Lothern high above the tidal waves that swamped Ulthuan. The third, and to date final, appearance of Amanar came during the Great Incursion. With a great sweep of his tail, he scattered much of the Dark Elf army. Then, ignoring the pinpricks of their blades, he turned and bore the Black Ark Intolerable Delight beneath the waves, never to be seen again. No sight has been of Amanar since that day, but a single great scale was recovered after the battle was done, which now forms the unbreakable heart of this shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_golden_crown_atrazar;Golden Crown of Atrazar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_golden_crown_atrazar_desc;No mere gemstones are set about this circlet, but brilliantly polished shards taken from waystones all across Ulthuan. Thus can the bearer of the Golden Crown draw upon the magics of the Great Vortex to guard himself from harm. Few wear the Golden Crown for long, however, for the souls of the dead hang heavy about its brow, and their whispered praises and encouragements would inflate the wearer's pride to epic proportions, driving even the noblest mortal into a dangerous, self-obsessing madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_moranion_wayshard;Moranion's Wayshard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_moranion_wayshard_desc;In the days of his youth, Moranion - of Athel Tamarha - wandered the realm of Yvresse as one of its Mistwalkers. Few could tread the fog-wreathed paths so surely as he, for he bore a wayshard attuned to the great watchstone at the realm's heart. Thus did Moranion walk the Daemon-haunted mists as easily he would have done under clear skies, leading ambushes of spear and bow to destroy the invaders. Though Moranion now sleeps eternally, his wayshard still glimmers with poer. Those who can unlock its secrets will never again find themselves lost, no matter how far they might stray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_khaine_ring_fury;Khaine's Ring of Fury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_khaine_ring_fury_desc;Khaine once had eight rings, or so the legends tell. Hekarti, Goddess of Magic, designed each of them to embody a single Wind of Magic. Vaul, the Godsmith, wrought them with all his cunning, binding to each a glittering gemstone that shone with the power of the winds. Khaine was much pleased with these gifts, for they gave him a mastery of magic which he had never before known. Yet the Lord of Murder was not to keep his prizes for long. \n \n Neither Hekarti nor Vaul had any love for Khaine, and had fashioned the rings out of fear of reprisal, rather than for filial duty. Moreover they worried for how the godly balance of power would be altered by what they had done. Thus did Hekarti and Vaul, whose love for each other could have filled only the very meanest of vessels, then conspire together to see Khaine divested. So did they tell Atharti, the Lady of Desire and most covetous of all the divine host, of Khaine's new treasures, hoping she would distract the Lord of Murder long enough for the rings to be reclaimed. Atharti immediately resolved to take the rings for her own, but Khaine would not part with them, no matter what seductive wiles she brought to bear. Eventually, they came to blows and, in the process, the rings were lost. To the great dismay of all who sought them, the rings had fallen into the mortal world, where Asuryan's law forbade the gods from treading. Over the centuries that followed, only one ring has been found, the black iron Ring of Fury. It has been brought to the battlefield only at times of greatest need, for no one wields the power of the gods lightly. Fewer still find it wise to so openly taunt the Lord of Murder with his loss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_sunfire_gem;Gem of Sunfire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_sunfire_gem_desc;Bound within this brilliant jewel is the angry essence of Angranir, greatest of the Flamespyre Phoenixes. During the civil war, Angranir was struck down by sorceries meant for Caledor, and neither Priestess of Isha nor learned physician could heal him. So it was that Aeldamar, High Mage of Tiranoc, was instructed to save Angranir's spirit, so that the noble bird's light could bring hope to Ulthuan for years to come. Alas, by then, all that remained of Angranir was a burning brand of magic which, while formidable of temperament, now lacked any of the firebird's intelligence or majesty. Nonetheless, Aeldamar did as he was bid, and preserved the enchanted flame within a many-faceted topaz. Mindless still, Angranir's fire lends its heat to the fires wielded by the bearer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_beard_cloak;Cloak of Beards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_beard_cloak_desc;To many High Elves, the Cloak of Beards is a relic of an unhappy hour. But, for a few, notably those whose ancestors fought in Caledor II's final battle against Gotrek Starbreaker, it is a valued reminder of the perfidiousness of Dwarfs. This latter group ensure that the Cloak of Beards is never lost: indeed, with every generation, it grows longer and more fulsome, as more beards are seized and woven into its folds. Now, its power is such that its mere presence subverts prideful Dwarfen works - even runes cease to function.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_book_hoeth;Book of Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_book_hoeth_desc;The Book of Hoeth is one of Saphery's most treasured artefacts. The very first pages are laid down in the hand of Bel-Korhadris himself, and every subsequent entry bears the seal of the greatest Loremaster of his time. Yet a great many of the Book of Hoeth's pages remain blank, for the scholars of the White Tower are aware that even their knowledge has limits, boundaries that must be driven back if a complete mastery of magic is to be achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_world_dragon_banner;The Banner of the World Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_world_dragon_banner_desc;Elven legends tell that Draugnir, Father of Dragons, was welcomed in Asuryan's court as an equal, for mortal Elves and gods alike were awestruck by his might and nobility. Alas, not all the Elven pantheon were so enamoured. Anath Raema, sister to Khaine and goddess of the savage hunt, saw him as nothing more than an upstart beast to be harried and hunted as any other. \n \n Taking up her spear, she pursued the Dragon through the heavens. The contest that followed shook the world to its core, rousing even wise Asuryan from contemplation. The Creator halted the battle, but came too late to save Draugnir, whose wounds were beyond healing. \n With a single word, Asuryan banished Anath Raema to the Mirai forevermore. From the corpse of his fallen friend, he worked to create a new land where Elves and Dragons could live in peace, beyond the jealousies of the gods. From Draugnir's bones, he forged Ulthuan's mountains, and from the Dragon's flesh he created its broad plains. Draugnir's glittering scales Asuryan gave into the keeping of Isha. She, in turn, passed them to her mortal children, the Elves, who wrought many fabulous works with them, chief amongst them a mighty standard, woven with silver and hung with gems of all shapes and hues. \n \n This Banner of the World Dragon endures to this day, a reminder not only of the bond between the Elves and Dragons, but also of that which binds both races to their ancestral home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_great_eagle_mount;Great Eagle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_great_eagle_mount_desc;The Great Eagles of Ulthuan have always been firm allies to the Elves. The histories tell that the two races have fought in one another's cause since the time of the Daemon invasion, but legend carries the friendship even deeper into the past. Indeed, in some tales, it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial away to the Underworld at Asuryan's command. \n \n Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures who long remember insults, and do not suffer foolish company gladly. When Asur armies assemble, the noble Eagles too join the battle. They swoop down upon the crew of enemy war machines, tearing them apart with powerful talons before using mighty wings to glide swiftly away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_flamespyre_phoenix_mount;Flamespyre Phoenix;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_flamespyre_phoenix_mount_desc;The Phoenixes of Ulthuan dwell amongst the Flamespyres - great alabaster pillars of rock that stand sentinel about the Shrine of Asuryan. These constantly burn with magical flame, for Aqshy gusts about these rocks as it is drawn inexorable towards the Isle of the Dead. Yet Ashqy has left its mark on more than the silent stones. Over generations, the Phoenixes of the Flamespyres have become attuned to fire magic, harnessing it at whim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_frostheart_phoenix_mount;Frostheart Phoenix;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_frostheart_phoenix_mount_desc;As a Flamespyre Phoenix ages, its body cools, amd even begins to sap heat from its surroundings. Finally the plumage that once blazed with fire grows heavy with frost and ice. Once this occurs, the Phoenix must leave the Flamespyres, for the chill that surrounds it causes agony in its brightly burning kin. Most such Frostheart Phoenixes dwell in lonely exile crags about the Eataine coast, until their bodies finally freeze solid, to leave curious frozen statues along the crags and cliff tops. Others return to the Shrine of Asuryan, to offer their final days in service as war-steeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_tiranoc_chariot;Tiranoc Chariot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_tiranoc_chariot_desc;The Asur of Tiranoc are an adventurous people, proud of their fighting traditions, and deeply embittered by the wars that have ravaged their realm. When the Phoenix King calls his subjects to war, the fiery knights of Tiranoc are always among the first ot answer, riding to battle at the head of a might chariot host. Spear-points and healms gleam in the light of the rising sun, and the ground trembles beneath thundering hooves. Banners of white, gold and blue stream in the wind. As one, the charioteers give voice to the battle hyym of Tiranoc, a rousing and beautiful anthem, sung at the mustering of the host since ancient times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

wand_of_wych_elm_desc;These type of wands are made from the famous Wych Elm Trees, ancient trees that often contain massive amounts of magic that can be more or less prevalent in each wand. Only the most talented wizards, such as Ariel as the Avatar of Isha, can wield such power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
acorn_of_the_ages;Acorn of the Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
acorn_of_the_ages_desc;The acorns from the Oak of Ages are acorns that fall of the Oak of Ages every Autumn.

talisman_of_qwarr_desc;Qwarr used to be one of the mightiest of all Great Eagles and an ancestor of Gwandor. In his fight against the dragon Grathgol, he perished after killing the dragon.

spear_of_kurnous_desc;The Spear of Kurnous is the massive weapon Orion wields for battle. Crafted from a birch tree of Isha's Garden and enchanted with spells it is able to heal its user.

sulephet_pegasus_mount_morathi_desc;The beloved mount of Morathi, the Dark Pegasus Sulephet is a coal-black, burning-eyed hell steed with enormous wings. Mist emerges from its nostrils, reminiscent of the poison gas that vents from chasms in the Northern Wastes. Sulephet greets the Hag Sorceress with eyes blazing with lust, hatred and a curious, twisted love.

#Generic Dark Elves
druchii_artifact_hydra_blade;Hydra Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hydra_blade_desc;The Hydra Blade was carved from a single fang of Akholrak, first and greatest of the War Hydras broken to Malekith's service, and like its many-headed namesake, its keen edge srikes repeatedly against its foes. Though Akholrak is dead now, torn asunder long ago by the talons of the great Caledorian Dragon Incalamir, its malice lives on within this gnarled and twisted sword. Only those of iron will can hope to dominate the Hydra Blade, for it is imbued with an echo of Aholrak's malice and is little inclined to suffer the commands of another. Most wielders discover the blade's wilfulness more than offset by its alacrity, but more than a few have perished needlessly in encounters where skill would have served them far better than speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_chillblade;Chillblade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_chillblade_desc;When Malekith obliterated the northern citadel of Har Kaldra, he offered neither warning nor quarter. The iron-clad fortress was blasted to rime-scarred splinters with a single cataclysmic spell. Ever after, the freezing north wind has wailed with the agonised voices of those who perished that day, and its chill grasp can be held at bay by neither fur nor flame. It was from scattered shards of Har Kaldra that the Chillblade was forged. Its merest touch freezes not only the physical body but also the soul within, leaving the victim paralysed and easy prey for his attacks' next strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_dragon_egg;Black Dragon Egg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_dragon_egg_desc;In Ulthuan, the egg of a Dragon is sacred, and harsh punishment awaits any who endanger or disturb a Dragon nest. In Naggaroth, a Dragon egg is naught but a potential source of power, and their nests nothing but cradles to nurture that power. So it is that for every Black Dragon Egg that develops into a hatchling, countless dozens more are taken and consumed, so that their devourers might take a portion of the egg's strength as their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_twilight_cloak;Cloak of Twilight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_twilight_cloak_desc;Woven from the hair of innocents and dyed with the blood of sorcerers, the Cloak of Twilight is all but invisible to the mortal eye. The cloak has served many masters well across the long centuries. It was this garb that allowed Morathi to keep a close watch on the Phoenix Court of Bel Shanaar, even from Nagarythe. Centuries later, it had passed from the Hag Sorceress' hands and became the tool that allowed the master assassin, Venomblade, to stalk the blood-slicked streets of Tor Elyr as he visited his night of Screaming Death upon the folk of that great city. Ownership of the Cloak of Twilight guarantees an ambitious Dark Elf the success he craves, but is not without risk. However determined its wearer, there is always a more ruthless pretender, his mind set to steal the cloak's power for his own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_amulet;The Black Amulet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_amulet_desc;Carved from the tortured heartstone of a mountain drenched in Dark Magic, the Black Amulet is a lustrous polished stone of midnight hue. It is engraved with a single glowing rune, and into its ebony facets have been poured all the captured malice and spite that emanates from the chill lands of Naggaroth. To behold its darksome shape is to see despair made physical, it is to abandon even the merest memory of hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hotek_ring;Ring of Hotek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hotek_ring_desc;Hotek was an outcast priest of Vaul. It was he who forged Malekith's rune-etched armour, and he also oversaw the creation of many of the Witch King's most terrible weapons. Renegade and turncoat though he was, Hotek was no fool. He knew that he lived only at Malekith's fickle pleasure, and so created for himself an armoury of defences - both magical and physical - with which he hoped to blunt the Witch King's wrath long enough to escape. Ultimately, Hotek did not perish at Malekith's hands, but was poisoned on Morathi's order. His armoury was broken up soon after, the scattered pieces changing hands with the ebb and flow of patronage and power. None of the artefacts have known as many masters as the Ring of Hotek, for this trinket of obsidian and black diamond is claimed to be the renegade priest's greatest work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_nagarythe_banner;Banner of Nagarythe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_nagarythe_banner_desc;During the sundering, many of Nagarythe's treasures were lost in battle or destroyed by natural disaster. Those that remained were greedily seized upon by nobles of both allegiances. Some fell into the hands of the Aesanar, who hid them away from Malekith's forces, but the most important were taken by the Dark Elves. The Banner of Nagarythe is the greatest of all such treasures, woven through with silver thread and inlaid with pearls and diamonds. For the Dark Elves, the Banner of Nagarythe is a physical reminder of the injustices heaped upon them by the Phoenix Throne. Moreover, it is the personal standard of the Witch King and proclaims his right to rule not only Naggaroth, but the ten kingdoms of Ulthuan as well. For their part, the Shadow Warriros of Nagarythe deem this banner too mired in corruption and betrayal to any longer have any wholesome purpose. They seek not its return, but its destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_spite_gem;The Gem of Spite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_spite_gem_desc;Many Dark Elves feel that a misfortune shared, if not exactly a misfortune havled, then at least one in which they can take a certain malignant (and possible posthumous) glee. Such was the goal behind the creation of the Gem of Spite. It was fashioned during a rare civil war in Ghrond, when sorceress fought sorceress in an attempt to claim a place at Morathi's right hand. The Gem of Spite still turns up from time to time, normally in the possession of one who has fallen from the Hag Sorceress' favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_sacrificial_dagger;The Sacrificial Dagger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_sacrificial_dagger_desc;This dagger is a tiny splinter of the cruel weapon wielded by Hekarti, Goddess of Dark Magic. It was shivered from her blade during a failed attempt to sacrifice her sister, Atharti, to an older and darker power than she. The shard was flung far and came to rest in the caverns beneath Ghrond. Here, amongst the bleached bones and rubble, itwas discovered by Khaeleth the Sorceress. She claimed the dagger as her own and learned how to unlock its power to transmute the soul-essence of living creatures into a raw and hungry magic. So began Khaeleth's rise to the foremost seat of power within the Dark Convent of Ghrond, an elevation marked by blood sacrifice and the darkest of sorceries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_tome_furion;Tome of Furion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_tome_furion_desc;Dark Magic is destruction incarnate - even it most basic precepts are corrosive to mind, body and soul. Few tomes containing its secrets therefore exist, for mere paper and papyrus smoulder to naught within decades of being inked with such sigils. THe tome of Furion is a rare exception to this rule. Its pages are flayed Orc hide, but the book endures its burdens thanks only to the carefully layered enchantments Furion bound into its covers.

druchii_artifact_dark_pegasus_mount_desc;Dark Pegasi make their nests on the northernmost peaks of the Iron Mountains. It is from these eyries that the Druchii steal young Pegasi to serve as steeds - a fully-grown beast is too savage to be trained.

Manticores can be tamed enough to take a rider, though they remain feral. Even if his steed occasionally ignores his commands and pitches him into unfavourable fights, a Druchii considers this a minor risk compared to the fear and respect such a mount brings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Small bands of Beastmasters roam the wilds in Scourgerunner Chariots searching for suitable prizes.

An item of great power, it drives events around its bearer to a crisis, where he can, by his own efforts, either gain a great victory or suffer a great loss. The bolt does not care about the goals of its holder, and those at a great disadvantage in a struggle for which they care deeply sometimes seek it out, trusting to the crisis to give them a victory otherwise unattainable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

At Karaz-a-Karak, the Throne normally resides in the cavernous Great Hall, raised upon a massive pedestal of polished stone.

beastmen_artifact_stonecrusher_mace_desc;This massive, heavy club is ringed with bands of cursed iron, and carries enchantments of shattering and destruction. A great blunt weapon with an iron beasthead at its tip, the Stonecrusher Mace has become a symbol of the Beast men's eternal desire to unmake that which Man has made, and to cast down his civilisation. Though it lacks an edge with which to penetrate armour, those struck by it find their bones turn to powder under the sheer brute force of the blow. Even castle gates have fallen to this weapon in its long and bloody history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_great_fang;Great Fang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_great_fang_desc;This pale sword is crude but sharp. It is clearly made from something other than steel, perhaps bone or ivory.

beastmen_artifact_fur_sharrgu_desc;This hide is a filthy mess of matted and stinking fur from a Chaos Spawn named Sharrgu. Sharrgu was an enormous Spawn, it was the great despoiler.

The Dark Heart is aptly named for a Beastman Warlord who tore it from the chest of an Elven Wizard before the Coming of Sigmar. So violent was the Elf's death that Khorne crystallised the heart and filled it with the Beastman's wrath. Those under the influence of its power are filled with a longing to kill, and will charge recklessly at the foe, filled with hatefuelled invigoration. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_beast_banner;The Beast Banner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_beast_banner_desc;This ancient banner is stitched together from pieces of hide hewn from literally hundreds of defeated enemies.

chaos_artifact_hellfire_sword_desc;The blade known as the Hellfire Sword was made from a single, searing flame that was hammered into material form and quenched in the blood of a fire-djinn. Those struck by it are set ablaze and may explode as their blood turns to liquid fire. The Hellfire Sword was first wielded by the Chaos Lord Garathor but, over time, it consumed his lifeforce until nought remained within his armour but ash. When the Hellfire Sword was prised from Garathor's ruined gauntlet years later, it flared so hotly that it fused into its new owners hand. Eventually, this fools spirit was also consumed, and the cycle began anew. Since its creation, a hundred mortals have borne this flame-wreathed blade, unaware of their doom until it was too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_artifact_change_sword;Sword of Change;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_artifact_change_sword_desc;The Sword of Change was wrought within the magical balestorm of the northern Chaos Gate. It was fashioned by the Daemon Warlord Amon 'Chakai, whose fossilised eye is still grasped in the weapon's pommel. The Sword of Change is saturated with the mutating power of Chaos. Even the air around the blade is in flux: at one moment, the blade is wreathed with the scent of sweet perfumes reminiscent of Slaanesh, only to be replaced a heartbeat later with the stench of rot and decay of Nurgle. An eye-blink later and the air around the Sword of Change shines with multicoloured hues of Tzeentch before being surrounded in a haze of misted blood associated with Khorne. This magical sword has the power to reduce those whose flesh it pierces into mindless, flailing mounds of flesh, warping their bodies into monstrosities known as Chaos Spawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, every time the bearer consults the skull, there is a chance it will reveal one of the true mysteries of the Realm of Chaos, imparting knowledge that blasts the mind with its scope and impossibility.
