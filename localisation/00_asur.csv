EVTOPTHIGHELF.2.a;It reminds me of the first light of a winter moon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.2.b;It reminds me of the first light of a winter moon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.2;This courtier has composed a stunning new epic, which brings tears to the eyes of anyone who hears it. At the feast table, even hardened warriors are seen with misty eyes, reminiscing of the glories of your ancient race.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.3.b;No, I think I'll sit this one out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.3;Foul creatures such as manticores and hydras sometimes make their way down from the Anulii mountains. Your huntmaster is arranging a great hunt, do you wish to join in it and perhaps win a new trophy for the walls of your feast hall?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAasur2;Asuryan blesses me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur3;You enter the flames with a steady heart, but the Gods do not favour you today. Asuryan's gaze passes through your protective spells and your flesh is scourged with fire.

EVTOPTAasur8;How could this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur9;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to pass through the Flames of Asuryan, but the God saw his wickedness and burned him, leaving nothing but a blackened carcass in his wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCasur14;I am afraid the Faction I represent must insist on changing the current political stance of Ulthuan regarding the outside world.

EVTDESCasur21;I am afraid the Faction I represent must insist on changing the current political stance of Ulthuan regarding the outside world.

EVTDESCasur20;Ulthuan recognizes its role as the sole protector of the whole world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur20;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur26;Now that the land has been freed from uncivilized indigenous barbarians, it can be assigned to a proper well-bred elven legate who will oversee its colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur26;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur29;The appointed ruler of your newly acquired land abroad has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] needs funds to start the project of colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur29;I will pay for it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur29;All the Princes of Ulthuan should contribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasur29;We cannot spare the resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasur30;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur31;The Phoenix King has issued a special tax to fund the effort of Asur colonization abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBasur31;Unspeakable waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur32;Sadly, Ulthuan cannot spare resources to forward to your colony right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur32;Did they abandon us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur33;One of your colonies has reported a great victory for the Asur. As customary, they've sent a tribute containing a share of their spoils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur33;I'll take them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur33;All the Princes of Ulthuan who supported them should take a share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur34;News has reached you one of Ulthuan's colonies reported a great victory. Even so, the Phoenix King withheld any profits of this success from the Dragon Princes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur34;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur35;News has reached you one of Ulthuan's colonies reported a great victory. The Phoenix King has sent part of the profits to all those who supported Elven intervention outside Ulthuan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur35;Sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur35;I suppose it's fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur36;[From.GetTitledFirstName], owner of one of your colonies, has sent a large tribute to Ulthuan to confirm [From.GetHerHis] staunch dedication to the Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur36;We graciously accept this tribute for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur36;We shall share this tribute with all the Princes who support us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur37;News has reached you one of Ulthuan's colonies sent a large tribute to Ulthuan, but the Phoenix King seems to have withheld it all for [From.GetHerHim]self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur37;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur38;News has reached you one of Ulthuan's colonies reported a great victory. The Phoenix King has sent part of the profits to all those who supported Elven intervention outside Ulthuan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur38;Sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur38;I suppose it's fair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur39;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sends a call for help to Ulthuan, for the Phoenix King to aid [From.GetHerHis] colony in its time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasur39;Ulthuan will join our brethren and fight alongside them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur39;I will fund the colony's effort on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur39;All the Princes shall provide help for our brethren abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasur39;We cannot spare any resources right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur40;Ulthuan has answered your call for help, sending resources and soldiers to aid you in your time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur40;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur41;One of Ulthuan's colonies is entangled in a war with an uncivilized race. The Phoenix King has issued a special tax to help it in its struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur41;I'll gladly pay it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur41;Unspeakable waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur42;The Phoenix King has decided it is not in the best interests of the Asur to aid you right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur42;Did they abandon us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur43;One of Ulthuan's colonies is entangled in a war with an uncivilized race. The Phoenix King has declared to mobilize the entire Kingdom to help them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur43;Let us march with them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasur44;Quell your fears, for the Phoenix King has heard your call and all of Ulthuan shall come to aid you against your enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur44;Praise the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasur46;We accept this donation with an open mind and open gates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur46;I'm afraid this still won't do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur47;The messengers return with an envoy from Ulthuan: the Phoenix Prince was moved by your plea and has decided to reopen Ulthuan's shores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur47;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur48;Sadly, Ulthuan does not feel the world is worth saving, despite your efforts to convince them otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur48;What about my boatload of treasure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur50;Gaen Vale, the most sacred place for the Asur, the core of Ulthuan and the centre of the Vortex which keeps the Chaos from pouring in and unravel the World is under attack. Would you stand with the Everqueen and defend the very heart of your homeland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur50;Sail, to war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur50;May the Gods protect them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur54;Magnificent [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI write you to humbly request on behalf of [From.GetFirstName] that you may accept [From.GetHerHim] to your court.

EVTOPTAasurdebate16014;It certainly is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate17;[From.GetFirstName] talks with you for quite a long time and does not shy away from showering you with kind and elaborate words to weave your virtues. Yet, as the discussion goes on, you start to see how [From.GetSheHe] is hinting more and more to something more than simple pleasantries.\n It would appear your host is interest in formally proposing to you, as [From.GetSheHe] says, for the betterment of both yourselves and of your subjects, who will certainly rejoice to such an alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17;You make a compelling case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate17;How much is this betterment worth to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate17;If I concede to this, will I count on you later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasurdebate17;I'm afraid this is not agreeable to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17001;It is truly wonderful for you to hear that [From.GetFirstName] fully shares your expectations and desires. You are quick to lead [From.GetHerHim] with you at the centre of the gazebo and stop the musician with a kind gesture, to call everyone's attention and formally propose to [From.GetHerHim]. \n You had already called a priestess for such a possibility and lose no time in asking her to perform the rite right there and then, so that you and [From.GetFirstName] may be joined forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17001;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate17011;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate17002;You've done your best to make your proposal as reasonably and passionately as it could possibly be balanced, yet it doesn't seem to be enough for [From.GetFirstName]. As a proof of your love and commitment, [From.GetSheHe] asks for tangible action and a dowry of some sort.\n You might be able to reach an agreement with [From.GetHerHim], provided you give a sufficient sum of money, taken from your personal estate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17002;Hm, very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate17002;This is too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17012;Once [From.GetFirstName] has provided [From.GetHerHis] part, you have no problem accepting [From.GetHerHis] proposal. Your host is quick to lead you to the centre of the gazebo and stop the musician with a kind gesture, to call everyone's attention and formally propose to you. \n [From.GetFirstName] had already called a priestess for such an occasion and loses no time in asking her to perform the rite right there and then, so that you and [From.GetFirstName] may be joined forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17012;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17022;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to truly show [From.GetHerHis] love to you in a tangible way, providing an acceptable dowry for your wedding. At this point you have no other choice but to refuse this foolish proposal entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17022;How unfortunate we could not reach an agreement…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate17003;You've done your best to make your proposal as reasonably and passionately as it could possibly be balanced, yet it doesn't seem to be enough for [From.GetFirstName]. As a proof of your love and commitment, [From.GetSheHe] asks for tangible action and show of trust.\n You might be able to reach an agreement with [From.GetHerHim], provided you consider [From.GetHerHis] acceptance as payment of the long standing .;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasurdebate17003;You've done your best to make your proposal as reasonably and passionately as it could possibly be balanced, yet it doesn't seem to be enough for [From.GetFirstName]. As a proof of your love and commitment, [From.GetSheHe] asks for tangible action and show of trust.\n You might be able to reach an agreement with [From.GetHerHim], provided you consider this act to even the personal obligation standing between the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17003;Very well, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate17003;I cannot allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17013;[From.GetFirstName]'s court was certainly charming, even moreso were [From.GetHerHis] promise of future support in the political matters. Your host is quick to lead you to the centre of the gazebo and stop the musician with a kind gesture, to call everyone's attention and formally propose to you. \n [From.GetFirstName] had already called a priestess for such an occasion and loses no time in asking her to perform the rite right there and then, so that you and [From.GetFirstName] may be joined forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17013;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17023;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to truly show [From.GetHerHis] love to you in a tangible way, providing presenting [From.GetHerHim]self as supportive in all matters to [From.GetHerHis] spouse-to-be. At this point you have no other choice but to refuse this foolish proposal entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17023;It was nonsense anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17004;You could understand if [From.GetFirstName] resisted to your courtship, but to attack you so abruptly? What a brutish thing to do. After all, what were you doing, if not celebrating [From.GetHerHis] beauty and virtue and what a fortunate union the one between you too would have been?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17004;Maybe [From.GetSheHe]'ll change [From.GetHerHis] mind in a few centuries…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17014;Unfortunately you had to be direct to convince [From.GetFirstName] of your refusal. This impoliteness to your host will certainly affect your reputation, but you are firmly sure it is the lesser evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17014;It certainly is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate18;The treacherous snake. [From.GetFirstName] has not invited you with any kind thoughts in [From.GetHerHis] mind: this was nothing but a trap, a conceited attempt to publically shame you out of some preposterous claims.\n The host points at you, raising [From.GetHerHis] voice in [From.GetHerHis] pontification to catch as much attention as possible, but still without shouting nor veering from polite and sanctimonious reproace to gross vulgarity.\n To prevent disaster, you must fight at [From.GetHerHis] own game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate18;I shan't stand for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate18001;The filth in [From.GetHerHis] tongue spurs from the filth in [From.GetHerHis] soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate18002;Time and again, you expose the lackings of your opponent, weaving [From.GetHerHis] failures upon [From.GetHerHim] as a coat, for everyone to gaze upon them.\n Time and again, your opponent fights back, contesting your claims and making some of [From.GetHerHis] own. The discussion goes on for hours, as the public continues to enjoy the music and the wine, with its ears always focused on you.\n Then, finally, brought to exasperation by [From.GetFirstName]'s claims, you cannot refrain from directly swearing at [From.GetHerHim]. As [From.GetSheHe] smirks with satisfaction, you both realize [From.GetSheHe] has won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasurdebate18002;Time and again, you defend against the preposterous accuses of your opponent, shaming [From.GetHerHis] conduct as a host and counterattacking with some insinuations of your own.\n Time and again, your opponent starts anew, skillfully defending against your quips. The discussion goes on for hours, as the public continues to enjoy the music and the wine, with its ears always focused on you.\n Then, finally, brought to exasperation by [From.GetFirstName]'s claims, you cannot refrain from directly swearing at [From.GetHerHim]. As [From.GetSheHe] smirks with satisfaction, you both realize [From.GetSheHe] has won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate18002;Hmpfh, you worthless..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate19;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been spending a lot of time celebrating you and your dynasty. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has talked to friends and acquaintaces about your great deeds and complimented your virtues with you in person.\n As [From.GetSheHe] goes on, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't shy away from trying to force out of you your opinion on some political issue [From.GetSheHe] seems to care very much about. At this point it would be incredibly rude to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19;And I will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate19;But still I must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate19001;[From.GetFirstName] could do nothing besides granting [From.GetHerHis] support after all you've said and done to stroke [From.GetHerHis] ego. It might have been somewhat debasing to spend so much time singing praises of someone else, but it served its purpose in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19001;It is an exercise in dialectic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate19002;[From.GetFirstName] did not seem to get the tone of your music. Such a waste of time and reputation will come to nothing. You've spent days praising [From.GetHerHim] amongst friends and acquaintances, yet [From.GetSheHe] still refuses to return your kindness with a hand of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19002;It is an exercise in dialectic at the very least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# DIVORCE
#
EVTDESCsdivorce1;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to divorce you. As the offended party, you can choose to demand compensation in the form of gold or land, if [From.GetSheHe] has any. If [From.GetFirstName] has not enough silver to pay you for, [From.GetFirstName] will receive a serious hit to [From.GetHerHis] reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce1;I don't really care, [From.GetSheHe] can go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce1;I'll demand monetary compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsdivorce1;I'll demand land from [From.GetHerHis] demesne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce2;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to allow the divorce proceedings to be completed without asking anything more than your part of the costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce2;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset by your decision to divorce. If you wish for [From.GetHerHis] cohoperation, [From.GetSheHe] has set up a punitive compensation for [From.GetHerHis] broken feelings and loss of status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce3;I don't have that kind of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3001;[From.GetFirstName] has capitulated to your request. After everything has been signed, you're ready to say goodbye to [From.GetHerHim] forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3001;And good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3002;[From.GetFirstName] has refused to give in to your demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3002;Just go away then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce3002;Then guess what? No divorce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3003;[From.GetFirstName] did not take well at all your refuse and has decided to retort annulling completely the divorce proceedings. It seems you'll still be married for some time after all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3003;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce4;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset by your decision to divorce. If you wish for [From.GetHerHis] cohoperation, [From.GetSheHe] has asked for you to give up to some of your demesne as a reparation for the damage caused by your hearthless soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce4;As long as [From.GetSheHe] goes away…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce4;I won't do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# MARRIAGE

EVTDESCAselfmarriage1001;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage1001;It seems [From.GetFirstName] has married another elf. Any other attempt at courship can certainly no longer taken in broad daylight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZselfmarriage1001;This was a waste of time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1001;I'l just ask [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1001;A generous show of wealth will prove my commitment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1001;A generous show of power will prove my commitment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1001;There must be some other way…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage1003;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with passion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1003;There must be some other way…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage1005;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1005;I shall hunt rare games for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1005;I shall gift [From.GetHerHim] the most precious items of my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1005;I will show [From.GetHerHim] exquisite pleasures such as [From.GetSheHe] has never seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1005;I shall give [From.GetHerHim] access to my vast library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2;[From.GetFirstName] has spent the past months drowning you in presents and gifts of all sorts, hoping to receive attention from you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2;I do like presents…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage2;What a waste of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2001;You spent a lot on [From.GetFirstName] but it certainly seems [From.GetSheHe] appreciated many of your gifts. Showing to be a dependable partner is certainly fundamental to put the basis of a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2001;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2002;Despite your efforts and expenses [From.GetFirstName] has not looked interested in any way to any of the presents you've riddled [From.GetHerHis] home in the past weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2002;Hmpf…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3;[From.GetFirstName] has tried many times in the past weeks to show off [From.GetHerHis] influence and power. You've had many acquaintances talk of [From.GetHerHim] in a throughly positive light and telling you what a wonderful spouse [From.GetSheHe]'d make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3;That is true…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage3;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3001;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] has worked flawlessly: you had to call in several favors and subtly have your friends work their ways into [From.GetHerHis] circle of acquaintances to tell [From.GetHerHim] what a wonderful partner you'd make, but it was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3001;Yes, it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3002;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] seems to have fallen flat: despite all the favors you had to call in from friends and relatives, nobody was able to convince [From.GetHerHim] of your good intentions and noble birth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3002;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another poem. You've lost count by now of how many sweet words [From.GetSheHe] has written for you in delicate and moving style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4;That is sweet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage4;How tedious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4001;You've spent weeks writing rhymes to [From.GetFirstName], and [From.GetSheHe] finally has started to mellow down on you. It was a lot of work, but you seem to have caught [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4002;All the sleepless nights spend writing poems to the sweet [From.GetFirstName] appear to have been for naught: [From.GetSheHe] remains cold to your delicate verses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4002;Hm…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5;From shows of light and illusions to work of art impossible to create for the most skilled craftsman, [From.GetFirstName] has given you quite a show of [From.GetHerHis] magical powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5;I'm impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage5;That's somewhat irresponsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5001;[From.GetFirstName] has certainly been impressed by the spells and incantations you worked on for [From.GetHerHim], weaving wind after wind to catch [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5002;Not even the Winds of Magic seem to catch [From.GetFirstName]'s attention. Your many attempts at impress [From.GetHerHim] with your magic have come to nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5002;How can one not appreciate the Art!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6;[From.GetFirstName] has been cornering you at every occasion, whispering sweet nothings in your ear and leading you in the most compromising places. You've resisted [From.GetHerHis] advances until now, but is it really worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6;Let's do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage6;Maybe later on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6001;[From.GetFirstName] couldn't have resisted for much longer. You've used all your skills in the past weeks to charm and seduce [From.GetHerHim] and your effort has finally given its fruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6001;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6002;You've used all the tricks you had, but [From.GetFirstName] appears immune to your charms. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe]'s not really interested in the physical aspect of the future relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6002;What else then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another exotic fur, fashioned after [From.GetHerHis] last kill. This suitor has spent the last week overflowing your home with trophies of [From.GetHerHis] hunts, all made in your honor, according to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7;It's beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage7;So many wasted lives…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7001;[From.GetFirstName] has been captivated by the trophies you've sent [From.GetHerHim] in the past days, result of your hard work in the wilderness. In fact, you've heard from multiple sources of [From.GetHerHim] wearing some of your furs in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7002;[From.GetFirstName] has not even pretended to accept your last trophy, sending the fur back with a polite request to stop your endeavours in the wilderness. It seems like this is not something [From.GetSheHe]'s interested in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7002;I see…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8;Another ravishing bouquet has been sent by [From.GetFirstName]. There have been several in the past days, accompanied by invitations to [From.GetHerHis] villa as well. You're wondering if it would be proper to accept at this point…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8;It does look enchanted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage8;I have no time for this frivolousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8001;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted your invitation to visit your gardens at the villa. You guide [From.GetHerHim] across the colorful landscape and soon captivate [From.GetHerHim] with the wonders you've grown within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8002;[From.GetFirstName] continues to ignore your floreal presents and the invitations to the villa. According to [From.GetHerHim] it is not a good period, but it might be that [From.GetSheHe] just doesn't like your flowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8002;I should try something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9;More than once in the past weeks [From.GetFirstName] has managed to drag you into some obscene, wild party which has left you sickly and confused at every morning. At first it looked unbearable, but now you've starting to see how this kind of entertainment could be something of an acquired taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9;See you again tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage9;Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9001;You've managed to sneak [From.GetFirstName] into more than one wild party in the last few weeks. At first [From.GetSheHe] didn't seem to appreciate your companionship, but [From.GetSheHe] has since then started to like celebrating excess alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9001;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9002;You've attempted to sway [From.GetFirstName] with wild feasts and intoxicating philters, but [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem interested in your kind of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9002;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10;[From.GetFirstName] is certainly meek for a suitor, if [From.GetSheHe] is a suitor at all. In the past week, [From.GetSheHe] has only been interested in spending time reading with you and talking about the ancient legends of your race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10;It is all so interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage10;What a bore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10001;You've spent days with [From.GetFirstName], nosedived in old tomes and ancient scrolls, studying the history of your great heritage. There is so much you seem to have in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10001;Did you read this one yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10002;Your attempts at showing some ancient elven scrolls to [From.GetFirstName] have failed, no differently from many other similar gifts. It might be [From.GetSheHe] isn't very interested in ancient elven literature…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10002;How can that be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage11112;Before you make your proposal official, you should decide what kind of union are you hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11112;A Regular Marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage11112;A Matrilineal Marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a matrilineal union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of matrilineal marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a regular union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of regular marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11;Before answering, I must consult my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage11;I could never disobey my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11001;[From.GetFirstName] was ready to accept your proposal. Not that there was ever any doubt about it: a courtier can hardly oppose the decision of [From.GetHerHis] rightful liege. A great ceremony will soon be held and the priestesses shall bind you in marriage, formalizing your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this matrilineal marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in matrilineal marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this regular marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in regular marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage12;I accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12;I cannot allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12001;You are heartened to hear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s answer to your proposal. A great ceremony will soon held to bind you and your newfound soulmate in marriage and formalize your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12001;I'm so happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12002;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] doesn't seem to share your feelings for [From.GetHerHim] and has refused your proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12002;How could you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13;Many elves come to partecipate at your wedding ceremony, congratulating both with you and your spouse, discussing politics and listening to the soave music in the air. The priests of many gods have come to celebrate your union, bestowing bestowing blessings of fertility from Isha on the bride, auguries of fortune from Lileath, advices of steady conduct to please Asuryan, promises of riches from Vaul and predictions of long life from Morai-heg. Offerings are brought to each of the shrines as you walk by them and receive the gods' blessings, binding you each time further together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13;And so we shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13001;The promise of life can only be bought by the certainty of death.\n You and your spouse raise the beating heart of the sacrifice to the shrine of Khaine and let it burn under the unforgiving gaze of the Lord of Murder, in the hopes it'll placate his thirst and allow your union to bear fruit. Only a few selected guests are honored with an invitation, dutifully kept afar and secretly watched by crossbowmen, ready to act at the first suspicious movement. Once the first ceremony is finally over, you leave the temple with your spouse, ready to make an ever more gruesome and enticing ritual to satisfy Atharti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13001;The gods watch us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13002;There is a time for everything. As you reach the spring of this cycle, you are united with your spouse, but, as all Asrai know, this time will someday pass and you shall be separated. In your marriage, you embody, in a small part, the sacred union of Isha and Kurnous and, like them and like all things, your happiness now will find balance in future sorrow. This is what the forest spirit remembers you as it gives its blessing and binds you together. Yet, as all cycles pass, you shall accept the nature of things with a light heart and do the best of what you have right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13002;We will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage1001;Since you're married already, it would not be appropriate to continue courting [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTXselfmarriage1001;It was fun while it lasted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# BLOODLINE EVENTS

EVTDESCwhBloodline2;Many years ago another of your blood passed through the flames and was left burnt, you have dealt with the scorn of that legacy all your life.

# ASUR GOVERNMENTS
#
everqueen_government;Court of the Everqueen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
everqueen_government_desc;The court of the Everqueen moves through Avelorn from place to place like a great carnival, pitching silken pavilions of myriad colours wherever it halts. By day, silver laughter rings through the forest as the Elves make sport. By night, faery lights flicker in the darkness, drifting behind the Everqueen's courtiers and illuminating the revels and feasting. With its perfect weather, bountiful forests and beautiful near-immortal inhabitants Avelorn seems the sort of rustic paradise of which mortal men can only dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
highborn_government;Highborn Concordate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
highborn_government_desc;The High Elves rely on a mild form of autocracy, centered on cities rather than fortresses. While the elven Princes are respected and obeyed and pass down their titles by blood, they are required to treat properly all their highborn subjects. Elven rulers cannot imprison any of their subjects without a proper reason and cannot revoke titles from their elven vassals, except in some extreme circumstances. In return, they have absolutely no obligations in regards of their inferior non-elven subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

faction_interventionist_elves_ultimatum;Demand liege to open borders;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
faction_interventionist_elves_ultimatum_desc;Ulthuan should not cower away from the world, hopelessly leaving the other races to their own limited means. It is time for the Phoenix King to accept that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

asur_meeting_decision;Private Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;
asur_meeting_decision_desc;Your many connections amongst the refined Asuryan aristocracy allow you to organize a meeting between you and a fellow Asur, an invitation too polite and prestigious to refuse, after which, you will be able to put your skills of orator to good use and see if you can come to some arrangement with [Root.GetTitledFirstName].\n\n Once you've met with the other ruler, you shall be able to discuss matters of marriage, favors and gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
