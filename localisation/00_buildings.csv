upgrade_great_cathedral_of_manann_desc;The "Crown Jewel" of Marienburg, the magnificent Cathedral of Manaan is the undisputed centre of the Sea God's cult in the Old World - even the Grand Chapel in Miragliano defers to its supremacy. Over two thousand years old, its cornerstone is said to have been laid by Marius himself in a pious act after his great victory over the Fimir.;;;;;;;;x

upgrade_the_reiksport_desc;This fortified port is used both to unload cargo of merchant vessels, and as the headquarters for Reikland Fleet of the Imperial Navy. A bustling shantytown has grown up around the Reiksport over the years to service the merchants and sailors;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_grand_temple_of_sigmar;Grand Cathedral of Sigmar;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_grand_temple_of_sigmar_desc;the greatest temple and most sacred space of the Cult of Sigmar, located in the Imperial capital city of Altdorf. It is the seat of the Grand Theogonist and is considered one of the true marvels of the Old World. It is, in of itself, the largest and most powerful religious edifice within the Empire and beyond. Some argue it is a more important centre of political power in Altdorf than even the Imperial Palace.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_palace;Imperial Palace;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_palace_desc;The Imperial Palace of Altdorf, overshadowed in that city only by the Cathedral of Sigmar, is a massive, highly elaborate keep standing near the middle of the Imperial capital city. The palace is home to both the infamous Reiksguard household guards.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_zoo;Imperial Zoo;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_zoo_desc;The Imperial Zoo in Altdorf is home to some of the most dangerous monsters of the Old World. This menagerie contains all manner of grotesque monstrosities, such as the Abomination of Stirland, the Drakwald Gibberbeast and many more. In addition to being one of the wonders of the Old World, the Imperial Zoo also has a practical function, stabling the Emperors' more dangerous and bizarre mounts.;;;;;;;;x

upgrade_library_of_verena_desc;One of the Great Libraries of Verena.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_college_of_magic;College of Magic;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_college_of_magic_desc;The Colleges of Magic are places of learning as well as inherently political institutions. They each possess physical buildings and are inhabited by a collection of non-magic-using servants, apprentices and Magisters, the title given to a wizard who is a full member of a college and therefore licensed to practice and teach magic.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_human_university;University;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_human_university_desc;The university is attended by all types—idle nobles, diligent middle class youths, and even some lucky and inspired folk from poorer backgrounds,Universities are commonly hotbeds of sedition and revolutionary talk—on the part of both students and professors. causing issues for the ruling class for cultural advancement.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_temple_of_taalite;Grand Shrine of Taal;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_temple_of_taalite_desc;Located in Taalwelt forest in northern Talabheim rests the great shrine to Taal and Rhya true to the nature, unlike the temple of taal within the city. The priests of Taal alternate between Taalwelt and the temples in the city to carry out their rituals.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_ottilian_statue;Statue of Ottilia I;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_ottilian_statue_desc;At the marketplace of Talabheim stands an imposing ancient and worn statue depicting Empress Ottilia as a consort of Taal.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_high_watch;High Watch;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_high_watch_desc;High Watch is the central bastion that protects the only entrance into the Imperial city-state of Talabheim. The gates are kept open except during times of crisis. High Watch has four separate black-iron portcullises, well-greased and connected to a series of levers that can release the gates to slam shut with a single command. The walls and ceiling inside this tunnel are lined with murder holes, offering a great field of view for crossbowmen and soldiers to dump boiling oil in case an army actually makes it that far.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_the_watch;City Watch;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_the_watch_desc;Corruption is common within watch organisations. Up to a third of a watchman's income can come through illicit methods. A few watchmen enlist for duplicitous reasons- they are supporters of local gangs or simply sadists. However, the majority are not crooked. They are well-meaning, albeit jaded, law enforcers who do not have a clear understanding of the laws they intend to uphold.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_state_army_barracks;State Army Barracks;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_state_army_barracks_desc;Barracks housing the many state troops within them.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_foundry;Imperial Foundry;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_foundry_desc;Large segment of this city's industrial district has been converted into military foundries to keep the men of nation well equipped in battle.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_engineers_school;Engineering School;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_engineers_school_desc;Teaches many young aspiring engineers in field of metallurgy and engineering and using many of the created weapons, creating many weapons of war for the nation in process.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_engineers_school;Imperial Engineers School;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_engineers_school_desc;The Imperial Engineers School was founded in 2012 IC by the Tilean genius Leonardo da Miragliano, with the name of Stephan Franz School,[9a] thanks to the funding from the Prince of Altdorf. Those were difficult times riven with discord and war, notably due to the Vampire Count Vlad von Carstein. Leonardo founded the school so that his legacy might live on in the heart of the Empire.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_gunnery_school;Imperial Gunnery School;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_imperial_gunnery_school_desc;Far more successful than the ill-conceived College of Engineering, the Imperial Gunnery School is not only Nuln’s most famous attraction, but it’s also the most breathtaking example of Nuln’s innovative architectural skills. A huge sprawling building with towers kissing the clouds, leering gargoyles, and gigantic flying buttresses, the Imperial Gunnery School draws visitors who just wish to see it, to say nothing of the nobles who send their sons to study here.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_artillery_workshops;Artillery Workshops;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_artillery_workshops_desc;It’s true that the College of Engineering and the Imperial Gunnery Schools do in fact produce guns, but the fact of the matter is that they do not produce all of the weapons exported from Nuln. Most, in fact, come from the artillery workshops in the Industrielplatz. There are six workshops scattered throughout this district, two of which are owned by the Richthoften Foundry and two more by the Countess herself, while several prominent families share ownership in the last two shops. The workshops all have similar layouts, with half the facility devoted to parts storage and the rest holding casting and assembly areas. Raw materials come from the foundries and other businesses that supply wheels, bolts, lubricants, and other needed supplies to assemble the weapons.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_richtofen_foundry;Richthofen Foundry;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_richtofen_foundry_desc;The Richthofen Foundry is at the leading edge of Nuln’s metalworking industry. The Richthofen family controls the largest Foundry and supplies over half of the Imperial Gunnery School’s raw materials. The foundry employs 300 workers and demands 14- hour shifts, six days a week. Though at least one man dies each week in the foundry, there’s a waiting list of people looking for work here. Karl Richthofen inherited the family fortune and foundry five years ago. A dedicated entrepreneur, he expanded the business by filling the needs of the Empire during the recent troubles in the north. He strong-armed or had killed his competition, to bring them under his family’s control, gaining contracts throughout the Empire.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_iron_tower;The Iron Tower;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_iron_tower_desc;Rising from the centre of the River Reik in the center of Nuln is a black and red tower, pointing like a finger at the heavens, as if to remind Nulners of Sigmar’s wrath. Called the Iron Tower, it symbolizes Nulner justice at its worst. It is a dark place, a place where people go in and never come out.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_collegium_theologica;Collegium Theologica;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_collegium_theologica_desc;The Collegium Theologica was founded in 1762 IC to train students for the priesthood of Ulric, and to promote the study and dissemination of the cult's religious writings. Since then, its scope has broadened into just about every field of study and it ranks among the foremost centres of learning in the Old World.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_middenplatz;The Middenplatz;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_middenplatz_desc;The awe inspiring Parade square surrounded by uniformal barrack buildings highlighting the Graf's Palace;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_high_temple_of_ulric;High Temple of Ulric;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_high_temple_of_ulric_desc;Constructed atop of the Eternal Flame, large imposing structure housing the Ar-Ulric and Order of the White Wolf.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_viaducts;Grand Viaducts;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_viaducts_desc;Four mighty viaducts lead to Middenheim’s gates. Three of these rise from the surrounding lands and wend their way up to the city’s north, west, and south gates. The fourth causeway travels to the city in a level line, running from the peaks of the Middle Mountains. These incredible structures represent a unique collaboration between Dwarf engineering skill and Human magical prowess.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_fauschlag;Fauschlag;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_fauschlag_desc;meaning "Fist-strike," is a massive plateau of white rock that forms the rocky foundations of the grand city of Middenheim. Legends speak of the creation of the Ulricsberg. The brothers Taal and Ulric were the most powerful of the gods. Both were widely worshipped. And yet Ulric was troubled, for it seemed that his older brother came before him in all things. To Taal he voiced his concern. Taal asked what would make him content, and Ulric replied that he desired a place, a realm that he could truly say belonged to him alone.;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_taalbaston;Taalbaston;;;;;;;;x
upgrade_taalbaston_desc;The Taalbaston is the greatest of Talabheim’s defences. Formed from the natural walls of the massive crater, the rim of the Taalbaston has been reinforced and constantly improved for centuries by the militaries of Talabheim.;;;;;;;;x
#
wonder_marienburg;Marienburg City;;;;;;;;x
wonder_marienburg_desc;Marienburg is considered to be the largest trading hub in the Old World and is the greatest of its ports. Straddling the mouth of the River Reik as it drains the mainland into the Sea of Claws, nearly all maritime trade that concerns Bretonnia and the Empire happens here. It is a place of great wealth and great opportunity. It is a place despised by the Empire, despite its reliance on the fabulous port city’s good fortunes.;;;;;;;;x
wonder_metropolitan;Metropolitan City;;;;;;;;x
wonder_metropolitan_desc;One of few Grand Metropolitan cities of Old World.;;;;;;;;x
wonder_middenheim;Middenheim City of the White Wolf;;;;;;;;x
wonder_middenheim_desc;Founded before the Empire was born, the giant mountain on which Middenheim sits, called the Fauschlag or Ulricsberg, towers high above the surrounding Drakwald, like an island of defiance against a rising sea of green and corruption. Since its founding, the grand city of Middenheim has never fallen to any invader that dares to assault its towering walls. \n Four great causeways lead from the ground to the city's gates, connecting Middenheim with the roads to Marienburg, Kislev, Talabheim, and Altdorf. From its ramparts cannons point in all directions, showing the willingness of the people of the White Wolf to do battle anytime, anywhere. Central to the city is its identity as the home of the chief temple of the Cult of Ulric and its High Priest, the Ar-Ulric;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_pyramid;Black Pyramid of Nagash;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_pyramid_desc;The Black Pyramid was built by slaves brought to Khemri from all over Nehekhara. Made from stone the colour of ebony, it is not just a monument to Nagash's pride, it was designed to store death magic and to amplify his powers.;;;;;;;;x
wonder_inevitable_city;Inevitable City;;;;;;;;x
wonder_inevitable_city_desc;The Inevitable City is one of the few places where Daemons of all four Gods of Chaos can be found,tormenting the lost souls who become unwittingly ensnared by the paths that lead to the city. Other servants of the Ruinous Powers congregate within its walls and plot the downfall of the old world.;;;;;;;;x
wonder_phoenix_gate;Phoenix Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_phoenix_gate_desc;The Phoenix Gate was well named, for over the course of its existence it has been reduced to ruble and rebuilt on several occasions. Yet its garrison are little worried by this seemingly grim record. A great many of the Phoenix Gate's soldiers are drawn from the Kingdom of Eataine, and they simply assume such woes to be part of Asuryan's ineffable plan. 'Should the enemy topple our walls,' they say 'then we shall simply build them higher and grander than before.' And so they have, many times. Indeed, the towers of the Phoenix Gate now stand so tall that their spires are lost within the clouds that hang heavy about the Annulii Mountains.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_dragon_gate;Dragon Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_dragon_gate_desc;The Dragon Gate is the largest and grandest of all Ulthuan's fortresses. When Caledor the Conqueror laid down the foundations of the great gates, he knew he would been unable to spend much time at court in Lothern, so enshrined the Dragon Gate as his war capital. He ordered a great palace be built into the heart of the fortress. The Dragon Gate's garrison too was established on a suitably grand scale, with near twice as many soldiers under arms as any two of the other great gates combined. Such an obvious display of martial pride soon proved an irresistible lure to the Dark Elves, and within a decade of the Dragon Gate's completion, no fewer than six of Malekith's armies broke themselves upon its walls. Now, like much of Ulthuan, the Dragon Gate is only sparsely occupied.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_unicorn_gate;Unicorn Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_unicorn_gate_desc;The Unicorn Gate guards the longest and most treacherous of the mountain passes. As a result, it has seen less conflict than its sister fortresses — even the most determined of Dark Elf attackers see little purpose in breaching the Unicorn Gate simply to fight their way through the Harpy- and Cockatrice-haunted ravines that lie beyond. For all this, the garrison of the Unicorn Gate are no less tested than those of other strongholds, for they are under constant attack by the denizens of the very pass they guard.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_griffon_gate;Griffon Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_griffon_gate_desc;The Griffon Gate is the oldest of Ulthuan's great mountain fortresses. It is also held to be unlucky by those who serve within it, for it always seems that foes besiege the Griffon Gate long before they consider carrying their blades against its sister fortresses. Yet the Griffon Gate's defenders forgive their fortress its odd fortunes, for there is still honour to be earned upon its walls. Furthermore, to be present upon the walls of the Griffon Gate at sunrise, it is said, is to be reminded of the Golden Age of the Elves, and to know one's hope reborn.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_eagle_gate;Eagle Gate;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_eagle_gate_desc;From atop the Eagle Gate, one can catch the scent of the sea, a dark and musky aroma that sends a chill down one's spine as one thinks of the cold, evil lands that lay beyond it. In stark contrast, if one turns eastward, one can see the rolling steppes of Ellyrion as a golden brown haze, its bounteous lands warming the heart of many who keep watch this high up in the mountains.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_druchii_watchtower;Watch Towers of Naggaroth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_druchii_watchtower_desc;Naggaroth is a land in little danger of invasion. Few enemy fleets survive more than a few hours in its corsair-infested waters, let alone long enough to close with the jagged coast and land troops. The only real danger comes from hordes of Chaos that roam the frozen wastelands to the north. The Naggarothi have founded many great citadels to hold the hordes of Northmen at bay. Each of these Watchtowers is the size of a city, provisioned to withstand years of siege and garrisoned with a great host of Naggaroth's foremost warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_tower;The Black Tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_tower_desc;At the center of Naggarond stands the Black Tower. No mere fortress is this, but a city within a city -- a maze of palaces, ramparts and towers huddle within its curtain walls and jut from its sheer sides. Here dwell those nobles held highest in Malekith's regard -- an honour that brings wealth and patronage, but also danger. The Witch King has ever been a volatile monarch, generous when fortune smiles, but unflinchingly merciless when all does not go his way. Naggarond's court is therefore a place of rapid rises and meteoric descents -- few can play this game of politics for long, and none who take part die a natural death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_ghrond;Ghrond;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_ghrond_desc;The Tower of Ghrond is home to the feared Sorceresses of Naggaroth, long ruled by their Queen Morathi, mother of Malekith himself. It is a near impenetrable fortress, and the last line of defense against the hordes of the northern Chaos Wastes, should the watch towers fail to hold them back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_gallows_tree;Gallows Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_gallows_tree_desc;The Gallows Tree is a warped and horrific entity in its own right. Its tangled limbs are coiled and spread as if distorted in pain and held high above a rot-strewn swamp of vine-choked thorns, looming higher than a Temple's steeple above the desolate wastes. Foul and unutterable things dwell beneath its canopy, the tree being a living gateway to the horrors beyond this plane of reality. It is said that within lies an unclean hag-daemon, shunned even by her own kind, who will bestow hidden secrets and dark prophecy on those who please her. Those however who fail to meet her standards of devotion to Father Nurgle end their time as grisly adornments hanging from the boughs of the great tree above, food for maggots and crows alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zanbaijin;Arena of Zanbaijin;;;;;;;;;x
zanbaijin_desc;Zanbaijin,the ancient city older than the race of Men itself, which had long served as an arena for the favoured champions of Chaos to prove themselves worthy of the favour of their masters. By the ancient traditions of the Norse, Kurgan and Hung, the victor of the great battle fought at Zanbaijin would become master of all the warbands he had vanquished. The fame of such a warlord would travel far in the northern wastes, drawing untold thousands to his war banner with the promise of glory and battle to come.;;;;;;;;;x
skavenblight;Skavenblight;;;;;;;;;x
skavenblight_desc;Skavenblight is the foul heart of the Skaven Under-Empire and the birthplace of the Skaven race. Through magics more powerful than the unsuspecting world can imagine, the largest and most densely populated city in the world is kept secret, its locations only guessed at by the very wisest of mortal-kind. Deep in the rotting heart of the Blighted Marsh festers the vile capital of the ratmen, the decay-ridden nexus of all Skavendom. This shell of a once-glorious city of mankind lies more than half sunken in the morass, a testimony to the corruption and ruin spread by the Children of the Horned Rat.;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_fortress;Chaos Fortress;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_fortress_desc;The Chaos Wastes serve as the principle arena of the mortal world in which the Dark Gods of Chaos play out their apocalyptic struggle for supremacy known to scholars of Daemon-lore as the Great Game. Amidst the impossible landscape, the armies of the Dark Gods clash in never-ending battles. These wars are fought not for glory, nor plunder, but simply to advance the unknowable designs of the Four. Every day, the Wastes rock and shudder with titanic conflicts the likes of which unmatched by even the most incredible battles of the Old World. Champions of these battle build great strongholds and dark temples to their gods.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_morceaux;Morceaux Valley Vineyards;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_morceaux_desc;The vintners of the Morceaux Valley are the best winemakers in the Old World. Such is the beauty of their product that even the Elves of Ulthuan have begrudgingly accepted the quality of the vintages,the High Elven emissary to Bretonnia calling it merely tolerable - praise indeed from the tall folk.;;;;;;;;;x

# ARABYAN UNIQUE BUILDINGS

ca_al_haikk;Al-Haikk;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_haikk_desc;Al-Haikk is traditionally the capital of Araby, whenever the nation is united. Once known as the "Jewel of Araby", the city has declined importance in recent years, with continued wars, disasters and sieges targeting it due its source of legitimacy as the seat of the Great Sultan of All-Araby. While it's usually called the "City of Thieves" nowadays, due to the rampant depopulation - and thievery - in some of its old quarters, and overshadowed by other thriving rival cities, it remains a prestigious location to all Arabyans.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lashiek;Lashiek;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lashiek_desc;The City of Corsairs is the centre of trade between the North and Araby. Befitting its status as the face of the Arabyan Empire, Lashiek is a spacious city of surpassing beauty - but it is also home to ruthless pirates and the greatest thieves in all the world.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_istrabul;Istrabul;;;;;;;;;x
ca_istrabul_desc;From the Peacock Palace, the Sultan of Istrabul rules over one of the most wondrous cities of mankind. Istrabul is a city planned by the finest architects and built by combination of skilled labour and magical assistance. To Arabyans proper, it is an upstart, but none can deny the sparkling brilliance of the City of Man's Desire.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_copher;Copher;;;;;;;;;x
ca_copher_desc;Fabulous wealth from its spice gardens have allowed Copher certain liberties in politics and education. The city is home to many scholars and attracts many learned men from other realms.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_martek;Martek;;;;;;;;;x
ca_martek_desc;Nestled into the Atalan Mountains and straddling key caraven routes, Martek is both rich and highly defensible.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_el_kalabad;El-Kalabad;;;;;;;;;x
ca_el_kalabad_desc;Strengthened by magic to create a bulwark against the undead, El-Kalabad is the greatest fortress in Araby.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_aliman;Al-Aliman;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_aliman_desc;Al-Aliman is an Arabyan Colony founded by Atruhayid corsairs, fierce mariners who still follow the old ways of Araby. Another recent colony with more spirit and ambition than solid power or wealth, it serves as a central hub of Old Worlder activity in southern Lustria. With spices and other exotic wares flowing through, and more and more adventurers and misfits arriving in search of adventure, the future of Al-Aliman seems promising and more importantly, profitable. It also fields famed Arabyan stallions, some of the finest horses in Lustria, not that there are many others to compete against!;;;;;;;;;x

ca_arabyan_qassabah_6;Arabyan Ksar;;;;;;;;;x
ca_arabyan_qassabah_1_desc;The Arabyan Ksar, or "citadel" in the Imperial tongue, is the central administration complex for all Arabyan military settlements. While the Ksar is the military might of the Arabyans, their architecture is legendary, full of impossible shapes, domed-roof buildings, and a myriad of spires, all linked with small walkways to get to-and-from. This not only serves to appease foreign emissaries, but to provide a confusing, maze-like structure, making it difficult for invaders to successfully take an Arabyan settlement.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tarikahwarriors_6;Tarikah Barracks;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tarikahwarriors_1_desc;The Tarikah are lightly armored sword-and-bow infantry units that act as the mainstay for any Arabyan army. While Araby fields the finest cavalry in the Human world, their infantry are nothing to scoff at, as the art of sword dancing and the skills of their bowmen are impressive.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_shushtar_5;Shushtar Warriors;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shushtar_6;Shushtar Warriors;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shushtar_1_desc;The Shushtar used to be an ancient Arabyan tribe that used mounted archery and lightning fast cavalry strikes to great effect against the old Nehekharan empire. While their tribe would eventually perish, their fighting style would not, and the Nomadic Nehekkas, Tevari, and the Urban Ramaccans now use it to once again wreak havoc onto their foes.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_shariati_6;Shariati Heavy Cavalry;;;;;;;;;x
ca_shariati_1_desc;The Shariati are the 'heavy' cavalry components of Cophic and nomadic Arabyan armies. Unlike the Shushtar, who use mounted archery and harass tactics, the Shariati make use of the sturdy Arabyan camel to deliver devastating charges unto enemy lines. It is also known that foreign horses(those that are not native to Araby) are afraid of camels due to their smell, and so the camel cavalry was also initially the reason for many Arabyan victories during the crusades.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_ramaccan_jannisaries_5;Ramaccan Janissaries;;;;;;;;;x
ca_ramaccan_jannisaries_1_desc;The Ramaccan Janissary is the penultimate, modern Arabyan warrior. Raised from a young age to be a killing machine, these soldiers are of the highest quality an Arabyan lord can field, and normally serve as his or her bodyguards and elite detachments in the field of battle. Heavily armed, incredibly disciplined, these warriors make short work of anyone foolish enough to stand in their path.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_cophic_mamluks_5;Cophic Cataphracts;;;;;;;;;x
ca_cophic_mamluks_1_desc;The Cataphract is an old Cophic idea made new. Much like the Ramaccan Jannisary, the Cophic Cataphract is an elite warrior of mostly noble stock, given the finest weapons, armor, steeds, and training to create a terrifying mounted warrior capable of smashing through enemy lines with frightening speed and grace.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_tevari_sanddevils_5;Sand Devils;;;;;;;;;x
ca_tevari_sanddevils_1_desc;In the harsh deserts and sand dunes of Araby and Nehekhara, heavy armour and infantry are mostly impractical. Due to this, and the nature of the lifestyle of the Tevari and Nehekkas, most of their number fight on horseback. Lightly armored, these warriors are quick enough to chase down even mounted skirmishers.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_the_forge_of_starlight_desc;The Forge is Starlight is the home for craftsmen and artisans alike within Athel Loren. At the heart of this realm lies one of the legendary Anvils of Vaul,whose roaring fires light up the forest every night to forge only the greatest of equipment for Wood Elf kinbands. Vaul's Anvil also acts as a temple to Vaul himself and so it is one of the few locations within Athel Loren where fire is sacred.;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_oak_of_ages_desc;The Oak of Ages is the beating heart of Athel Loren and the place where the Wood Elf realm was truly established. It is here that Ariel holds her court during the Summer months , disappearing inside the huge tree with Orion's ashes during the Winter, what occurs or even just what lies inside of the tree is unknown to all but Ariel and only a few other rare souls. The Winds of Magic are drawn to the tree and can alter its appearance depending on which wind is blowing strongest at that time, it is often said that a single acorn from the tree will have more magical power than most artifacts crafted by mortal races. Given the immense importance of the Oak of Ages, the Asrai will defend it more heavily than anywhere else in the forest, giving up their lives more than willingly to protect it.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_wydrioth;Wydrioth;;;;;;;;;x
tb_wydrioth_desc;The pine crags of Wydrioth are a realm under constant threat of invasion thanks to the dwarfs and Greenskins pouring down from the Grey Mountains. Its steep mountain slopes appear to be no more dangerous than anywhere else in Athel Loren, it is only when the invader moves beneath the eaves of the forest that they come across its true nature. Here the Asrai have shaped a whole fortress out of their sacred forest. Entire strongholds created out of massive oaks and a maze of rockbriar forming tangled and gnarled walls, all linked together by endless treetop walkways and tunnels fashioned out of the tree roots. This living defence has thrown back many a prospective Dwarf and even standing firm against a mighty Waaagh! The elves of this region are even more bloodthirsty and unkind to strangers than their kin, often cutting the attacking forces down to the last snotling.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_atylwyth_desc;The realm of Atylwyth has been locked in the cold embrace of winter for an eternity, each tree coated in a thick glazing of frost and every glade heavy with deep snow. Only a rare few forest spirits dwell in this icy part of the forest and these few that remain slumber through the ages. As a result of this disconnection from the forest, the elves of Atylwyth are highly militant, boasting one of the largest and most well trained force of Eternal Guard in the whole of Athel Loren for they are the only force willing to protect this part of the great forest.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_yn_edryl_koiran_desc;Yn Edryl Koiran, otherwise known as the King's Glade, is an immense and awe-inspiring clearing at the heart of Athel Loren in the realm of Talsyn. Ever since the Elves first entered Athel Loren this glade has been the centre of their civilisation, holding council here even before Ariel and Orion arrived. Over the centuries Spellweavers have crafted a great city in the ancient oaks that surround the glade, buildings and chambers made out of the living trees everywhere from their roots to the tree branches. To the unawary visitor, the city is invisible thanks to most of the inhabitants living either beneath the ground or above their heads as well as the centuries of magic woven into the area. The King's Glade is also where Ariel and Orion rule with the aid of their council made up of fifteen lord and ladies from the forest realm, an extraordinarily prestigious post for any Asrai to hold.;;;;;;;;;x

The City of Lothern is also the central trade hub of Ulthuan, and under the watchful gaze of the Sea-Guard, untold riches flow into this realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_caledor_dragonprinces;Dragon Princes of Caledor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_caledor_dragonprinces_desc;Caledor was once the mightiest of the Elven realms, due to its wizard-princes being able to summon the power of the mighty dragons which dwelt in the volcanic mountains of their realm. Now the dragons slumber for the most part and their numbers are greatly reduced, but the Dragon Princes are still amongst the finest warriors of Ulthuan, riding into battle on great mail-clad warhorses. It is said that the Dragon Princes are the only contingent in the Elf army which does not have to lower its banners in deference to the Phoenix King, such is their pride and great power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_couronne;Couronne;;;;;;;;;x
ca_couronne_desc;The traditional capital of Bretonnia, Couronne is a large sprawling city heavily protected by a formidable series of bastions and towers spread out over the high walls. At the centre of the city lies the king's palace, a large citadel which allows the monarch to observe the lowly peasants beneath them from a safe distance. The city of Couronne also stands out for being one of the few clean cities in Bretonnia, something it owes to the great temple of Shallya and to the natural springs which can be found throughout the city.It is commonly said that the people of Couronne are born in the saddle, an exaggeration but one that holds some element of truth as the Couronnians are famed throughout the land as experts on equine matters. Other Bretonnians would call them obsessed with horses but even they cannot question the fine skill of Couronnian horsemen.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_languille;L'Anguille;;;;;;;;;x
ca_languille_desc;First established by the High Elves as a trading port, the city of L'Anguille is truly one of the wonders of the Old World and still one of the main trading ports. The most obvious landmark in the city is that of the three-hundred feet tall lighthouse and the high walls that extend from it to surround the city. Both walls and lighthouse were constructed by the Elves and so bear the familiar signs of their fine craftsmanship which stands in stark contrast to the more recent and human built buildings within the walls. The oldest of the buildings inside the walls is castle itself which is located on a small island in the middle of the harbour, commanding the entire bay with its impressive defences.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_brionne;Brionne;;;;;;;;;x
ca_brionne_desc;Much like the other cities in the dukedom, Brionne is a city based around beauty rather than practicality. Nevertheless, the castle at the heart of the city remains a surprisingly well-defended fortress despite its beautiful exterior. The entire city is set upon a hilly peninsula that is only joint to the mainland through a narrow and easily defended neck, the land around forming a natural harbour. Due to the regions strategic position, the Dukes of Brionne are tasked with maintaining a fleet of warships to patrol the southern coast from whomever would disturb the realm.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lyonesse;Castle Lyonesse;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lyonesse_desc;Castle Lyonesse is located on the north-west coast of Bretonnia, built upon a large island just off the mainland. As a result of this naturally defensive position, the castle is heavily fortified both by its natural defenses and those established by the Duke such as the huge keep at the peak of the island. At the high tide it is possible for small boats to sail right up into the outer courtyards whilst at low tide the sea sweeps back revealing ruins on the sea bed, thus any invading army must time their attack to avoid being stuck in either the high or low tides.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_montfort;Montfort;;;;;;;;;x
ca_montfort_desc;The castle and town of Montfort are located on the Bretonnian side of the Axe Bite Pass, a crucial defensive location against both greenskins attacking from the grey mountains as well as the Empire, a realm with whom Bretonnia has been at war with just as much as they have allied with. Due to this strategic location, Montfort Castle is one of the best human constructed fortification in the Old World. Spreading out from the massive keep are five tiers of giant sixty feet walls which have been firmly constructed into the rock itself, protecting the large town of Montfort from any hostile invaders. Naturally the Bretonnians here have decided that their hard work has earned them the right to exact heavy tolls on merchants or any other traveller that braves the dangerous but utterly important pass. Ironically and in a true Bretonnian fashion, this also includes the towns own citizens who pay much in order to gain access to the inner sections of Montfort.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_parravon;Parravon;;;;;;;;;x
ca_parravon_desc;The impressive Bretonnian city of Parravon has been carved directly into the living rock from an outcrop of the Grey Mountains. Castle Parravon dominates the stunning city below from its high vantage point at the peak of the outcrop, tunnels stretching far down into the heart of the mountain further increasing its defensive capabilities. Parravon is also famous for its Pegasus Knights as the noble creatures themselves can be found in the nearby section of the Grey Mountains more so than anywhere else in Bretonnia.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_artois;Artois;;;;;;;;;x
ca_artois_desc;Built in the midst of the beastmen infested Forest of Arden, Castle Artois is a well-fortified keep that has withstood its share of battles. The castle's real focus however is around providing safe accommodation for the Duke and his many mounted warriors, yeoman and knights alike, who ride out on endless hunts against the beastmen of the forest.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bordeleaux;Bordeleaux;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bordeleaux_desc;The bustling port of Bordeleaux holds much in common with many of the other major ports in Bretonnia being built off of ancient Elven ruins from the time long ago where they lorded over this land. The mighty castle of the Duke rests atop a cliff that rises over the main harbour, the countless siege weapons on its walls being able to reach any point in the city and the bay. Over the years, Bordeleaux has found itself in an ongoing commercial rivalry between itself and the great northern port of L'Anguille, a rivalry that Bordeleaux has always been on the losing end of.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_gisoreux;Gisoreux;;;;;;;;;x
ca_gisoreux_desc;The city of Gisoreux is a bustling city filled with merchants and travellers from all across the Old World with it even being said that there are more Imperial traders in Gisoreux than any other city in Bretonnia. The massive bulk of Castle Gisoreux dominates the entire city, a single curtain wall runs for well over a mile long, enclosing two large keeps that provide accommodation and protection for many of the local dignitaries.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_mousillon_desc;Mousillon is a cursed, impoverished land that is plagued by constant misfortunes, disease and the attention of dark powers. A backwater region filled with marshes, bogs, and swamps.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_antoch;Antoch;;;;;;;;;x
ca_antoch_desc;The mighty city and fortress of Antoch was founded at the conclusion of the Crusades when the victorious Old Worlders vanquished the evil and perverted Sultan Jaffar. Disgusted at the evil that they found in Araby, the victorious knights tore down idols, burned whole libraries of dangerous books, and eventually retreated to the untainted lands of Bretonnia and the Lady of the Lake. However, some knights, driven into a frenzy of righteousness by the black-hearted evil and sickening decadence of the Arabyans, decided to remain and build a mighty fortress of virtue that would stand forever against the resurgence of darkness in the lands of Araby.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_bretonnian_knights_1_desc;It says much about a nation where the horses of its nobles live in far more luxury than most of the populace. Of course, most peasants do not have to ride to war in heavy barding or face the terrors that the Knights of the Realm do when in battle. Perhaps, therefore, if given the choice a peasant wouldn't swap his lot with that of a horse. A strange quandary, admittedly, but one that has been asked during many a tavern chatter.;;;;;;;;;x

Supposedly, this is so that the lords in charge of the fortresses can better aid and protect the peasants living in their land, as is their duty, but it's more commonly used to protect just the lord, and his own family and possessions, while the peasants have to fare for themselves. Typically, none of the lowborn men-at-arms and free riders are admitted inside, though Bretonnian lords commonly use the empty space to store more weapons and armor to better arm their peasants levies with.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_bretonnianmarketplace_1_desc;Due to Bretonnia's highly feudalized government and traditions, everyone that is not of noble birth belongs to a noble, with each noble being granted an estate which houses a number of serfs, retinues, and goods. In times of peace, the serfs tend to the noble's fields and the retinues keep a vigilant eye on the surronding lands, patrolling endlessly for malevolent forces. In times of war, a good many of the noble's serfs are levied into his or her's armies, and the retinues are folded into the core knightly units of the noble's army.;;;;;;;;;x

Here, Yeomen, both mounted and on foot are practice with their bows and longbows day in and day out. Yeomen are still peasants, so they cannot be trusted to stay on the field if things get hairy, but they can easily harass slower moving targets and deal damage to lightly armored targets.;;;;;;;;;x

Due to the peasants being barred from worshipping the Grails, no peasant soldiers can be found inside the halls of the monastery.

Due to this lifestyle, all shades are masters of the forests they patrol, and can silently stalk prey for miles, on top of being crack shots with their bows.

Unlike the Tower of Gorgoth, the purpose of the Black Fortress is as a purely military outpost, and is headquarters for the Legion of Azgorh. The legion is a mighty standing army which watches over the desolated southern Dark Lands, escorts the far-flung slave caravans through the Howling Wastes and stands as a bulwark against frequent invasions of Ogres, Orcs and worse from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

To create these powerful contraptions, they usually bind daemons to them and infuse their creations with the energies of Chaos. For the Chaos Dwarfs, magic and daemons are just another tool or resource, no different from iron and coal.

ct_magritta;Magritta;;;;;;;;;x
ct_magritta_desc;Magritta is the largest and probably the most important settlement in Estalia. Located on the southern shore of the peninsula, it's one of the main trading ports of the Southern Seas. Magritta maintains a strong maritime presence here, and aggressively patrols its waters against Sartosan pirates, Arabyan corsairs and, while at it, imposes a "toll" on foreign ships moving through its territory. It is also the home of the Archecclesiatium, the main temple of the Cult of Myrmidia.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bilbali;Bilbali;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bilbali_desc;Bilbali is, in many ways, a stark contrast to its southern rival, Magritta. Where Margitta's climate is warm and bright, Bilbali is always covered in rain and fog. While Magritta's golden shores are bathed by the temperate waters of the Southern Seas, the waves of the Great Ocean clash against the rocky cliffs of Bilbali. This is noticeable even their produce, as Bilbali's main export is the weaponry in their military arsenals and gunpowder refineries. It also acts as a trading hub between Lustria and the Old World, and the city is unusually welcoming of Bretonnian merchants ( For an Estalian city, that is ).;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cavadaco;El Cadavo;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cavadaco_desc;The Grand Colony of El Cadavo, is Estalia's gem in the New World, bordered by Skeggi to the north, pirates to the south, and of course the Lizardmen everywhere else. Due to the constant threat, protection is a major concern for the city, and as such they have spared no expense in employing the famed Tercio formations of Estalia to the New World. But the city is not all war, as it also sits in a strategic trade position, sending goods across the ocean home to Estalia.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_tomb_of_santiago_desc;During the dark years of the Arabyan invasion, Santiago de Vivar was the Champion of Estalia. His victories helped to slow the Arabyan tide and established his reputation as an invincible leader. In Santiago's final battle, he was slain by a poison arrow but even in death his body led a triumphant charge from the back of his faithful warhorse. His tomb is one of the holiest places in Estalia and many templar knights visit to draw strength from the spirit of Santiago.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_our_lady_cervantes_desc;Our Lady of Cervantes is a large temple complex built to commemorate the appearance of Myrmidia to beleagured Estalian troops during the early days of the Arabyan invasion. Inspired by their goddess, the Estalians rallied and won an important victory, delaying the northward march of Jaffar's legions. After the Reconquista, Our Lady of Cervantes has become an important centre of pilgrimage for the Myrmidian faithful.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_alhamra_desc;The foundations of Alhamra were built during the years of Arabyan occuption, when Sultan Jaffar believed he would need a fine residence for his new conquest. After the Reconquista, the Kings of Astarios took over the site and finished it, creating an elegant palace for their dynasty. Alhamra's fusion of Arabyan and traditional Estalian architecture symbolises the diverse character of Astarios.;;;;;;;;;

ca_cap_i_casal_desc;The Cap i Casal (head and home) of the Kings of Tigarre is a magnificent palace in Northern Estalia. Unlike the southern Kings, the monarchs of Tigarre never had to abandon their ancient residence during the Arabyan invasion. Indeed, many of the beautiful works of art housed within the Cap i Casal were rushed away from the south ahead of Jaffar's armies.;;;;;;;;;

ca_altdorf_desc; Altdorf is one of the oldest cities in the Empire, one of the and arguably its grandest, dating its foundations back to the time of Sigmar himself. Within the city's Dwarf built walls, establishments like the School of Engineers and the Cult of Sigmar conduct their day to day business protected by one of the most well equipped and trained armies in the Empire. Thanks to the city's vast wealth, it has profited from acting as one of the foremost centres of trade in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_middenheim;Middenheim;;;;;;;;;x
ca_middenheim_desc;Built upon a five hundred feet pinnacle of rock, Middenheim is the capital of the Imperial province of Middenland and one of the greatest fortress-cities in the realms of man, second only to Altdorf in size and influence. It is also home to the Cult of Ulric whose loyal followers would sacrifice their lives for defence of the city, the most fearsome being the legendary Knights of the White Wolf who would utterly dedicate themselves to the city's defence in a time of need.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nuln;Nuln;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nuln_desc;Nuln is both a spiritual and technological centre for the people of the Empire. Along with Altdorf, Nuln holds the second seat for one of the two Arch-Lectors of the Cult of Sigmar. The technological side to Nuln comes from its long and distinguished trade with the Dwarf holds, under whose expert guidance has allowed the engineers of the city to produce some of the best blackpowder weaponry in the Empire and the finest artillery crews.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marienburg;Marienburg;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marienburg_desc;The great city of Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in the entire Old World. Its wealth flows in from all corners of the world, no other city houses merchants from Ulthuan next door to those from far off Cathay like Marienburg. Due to this, the city enjoys a rich cultural mix which can be seen even among the local merchants who are renowned for their flamboyant ways.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_talabheim;Talabheim;;;;;;;;;x
ca_talabheim_desc;Located in the centre of a vast crater, Talabheim is the capital of Talabecland and serves to continually watch over the darkness of the Great Forest that covers the region. The city itself struggles to cover much of the crater, allowing farms to exist with its rocky walls which ensure a steady stream of supplies during sieges, only adding to the impregnability of the city. With the rims of the crater fortified and two large fortresses placed at its only entrances, Talabheim is truly a beacon of safety for poor souls travelling along the Old Forest Road and so has allowed the city to function as the main centre of trade in the area.;;;;;;;;;x
drakenhof;Drakenhof Castle;;;;;;;;;x
drakenhof_desc;Castle Drakenhof is situated on the peak of high clifftop from where it casts it's dark gaze over the blighted lands of Sylvania. The citadel was cursed even before Vlad von Carstein's arrival and made it his home, an event which would further damn Sylvania in the annals of history.;;;;;;;;;x
drakenhof_templars;Drakenhof Templars;;;;;;;;;x
drakenhof_templars_desc;This is a gathering place for the powerful Drakenhof Templars. The most elite unparalleled cavalry of the von Carsteins;;;;;;;;;x
ca_averheim;Averheim;;;;;;;;;x
ca_averheim_desc; Lying on the banks of the river Aver, the city of Averheim is the capital of the southern region of Averland. At the centre of this prosperous city sits the impressive keep of Averburg where the Elector Count takes up residence, safe in the knowledge that it has never fallen to an invading army. The fertile region of Averland is famed for its cattle and so during the warm summers it is common to see the stockyards surrounding Averheim to be filled with cattle merchants and their livestock, sometimes even crowding the streets within the city itself, a fact which has led to Averlanders and their cattle being the joke of Imperials from other provinces.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hergig;Hergig;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hergig_desc; Hergig is the heavily defended capital of the sparsely populated province of Hochland. Despite being covered by both the Drakwald Forest and the equally as dangerous Forest of Shadows, Hochland has surprisingly managed to remain resilient against the constant threat of Beastmen, Forest Goblins and other dark horrors lurking in the forests. This is mainly due to its highly skilled state troops who tirelessly patrol the forest. Due to many Hochlanders being trained hunters and marksmen, their state troops contain an abundance of archers and handgunners, the best of which are armed with the highly accurate Hochland long rifle, a weapon that has earned a fearsome reputation among the Empire's foes.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfenburg;Wolfenburg;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfenburg_desc;The people of Ostland can best be described by the provinces symbol of the bull. Stubborn and resolute, Ostlanders are a hardy folk as one would imagine given how close they live to the Chaos realms of the north. Due to this fact of life, Ostlanders are prone to a life of almost constant drinking with some even spending most of their lives intoxicated as a way of boosting their courage to deal with the harsh world around them. The city of Wolfenburg has long been a bulwark against the threats coming from outside the Empire and from within, even if the rest of Ostland has fallen, Wolfenburg will stand strong until the end.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirland;Wurtbad;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirland_desc;Wurtbad is the capital of Stirland, a rural and poor region in the Empire. Stirland has maintained a reputation amongst other Imperials of being a rural backwater despite the many large towns that dot the countryside. Part of this is due however to the nature of Stirlanders themselves who are for the most part a conservative and superstitious folk who have remained hostile to outsiders, something which becomes understandable given their close proximity to the cursed land of Sylvania. The armies of Stirland represent the poor nature of their region with most state troops not even able to afford a proper green and yellow uniform, carrying a small token of their region instead. It would be a foolish mistake to take this poverty as a sign of weakness as soldiers from Stirland are just as devoted and brave as other Imperial soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x
tp_manann_centre;The Great Temple of Manann;;;;;;;;x
tp_manann_centre_desc;The centre of the Manannite Cult is Marienburg. Much of the cult's fabulous wealth flows to the Great Temple, giving the high priests significant temporal power and prestige.;;;;;;;;x
tp_sacred_flame;The Sacred Flame of Ulric;;;;;;;;x
tp_sacred_flame_desc;Middenheim is home to the Great Temple of Ulric. The centre of the Cult's worship is the sacred flame, but the temple is more fortress than shrine. Its immensely strong walls shelter a vast army of Ulrican templars, all willing to fight and die at the order of the Ar-Ulric.;;;;;;;;x

ca_impcastle_1_desc;While most human architecture cannot compete with that of the elder races, the sons of sigmar can say with pride that theirs are fairly close to dwarf stock. Elegant, yet intimidating, Imperial castles are normally situated on points of strategic importance, such as river forks or high Plateaus. Like Tilean palaces of the south, Imperial castles often attract a small cadre of artists, scientists, and engineers.;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_bokha_palace;Palace Gospodarin;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_bokha_palace_desc;Set upon the crest of the Gora Geroyev, behind wrought iron gates, this mighty fortress rises tier upon tier of white stone towers and colourfully festooned battlements that reach their pinnacle as a great frozen dome, like a vast ice sculpture rising from the ground. Row upon row of armoured knights, with helms shaped like snarling bears, stand guard beyond the palace gates. Yet the true majesty of the palace is seen at night, when it is lit from below by vast Cathayan lanterns.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kislev;Kislev;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
ca_kislev_desc;The large and well developed city of Kislev is home to the Tzars of Kislev who rule over their empire from the Palace Gospodarin located in the heart of this grand city. As with the entire Empire of Kislev, the city remains under constant threat from Norscans and Chaos forces lurking to the north. Despite this constant menace, the city of Kislev has never fallen to an invading army yet, standing strong against countless sieges while the surrounding countryside burns. The Ungol and Gospodarian people who live here are a hardy folk, their horsemanship and combat skills forever tempered by raids coming down from the north which has enabled the Tzars to field one of the most fearsome mounted armies in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_praag;Praag;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_praag_desc;The fortress city of Praag is one of the few permanent settlements of the Ungol people, serving as their de facto capital, and the northernmost bastion of civilization in the Old World. Due to the city's unfavorable position, Praag has been forced to endure near constant raids by the Chaos-worshipping Kurgans and the savage Norscans for centuries. Though the majority of these raids are a minor inconvenience dispersed by raising a pulk of horsemen from the barracks, several networks of walls have been constructed concentrically around the city kreml with far more serious threats in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_erengrad;Erengrad;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_erengrad_desc;Located where the river Lynsk meets the Sea of Claws, Erengrad is the most important trading city in the region of Kislev, and the second largest port in the north after Marienburg. Much of the city's wealth and status are a result of the lucrative trade in gems and silver with the more civilized peoples of Norsca, many of the goods eventually flowing from Erengrad to the Empire, or even further afield. Despite this enormous inflow of wealth, the city spends any spare coin constantly updating their defenses to the most modern standards, largely preventing Erengrad's burghers from spending on the frivolities that define Marienburg and the Tilea's trade cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_hexoatl_desc;Hexoatl, the City of the Sun, is the most northerly temple-city in Lustria, located on the Isthmus of Pahaux. As such, it is the first line of defence against armies invading Lustria from the north. It is the most martial temple-city, defended with high walls and surrounded by an energy shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_itza_desc;Itza, the First City, is the oldest Temple-City of the Lizardmen. During the Great Catastrophe the city was ravaged by the forces of Chaos and was only saved through the sacrifice made by the Venerable Lord Kroak, the renowned Slann Mage-Priest. Summoning the Deliverance of Itza, he banished every daemon in the city, but in doing so seared all other spells from his mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_tlaxtlan_desc;Tlaxtlan, known as the City of the Moon, was once renowned for its astromancers and prognosticators. They observed the moon and the stars in order to make accurate predictions of future events. However with the Great Catastrophe and the appearance of the second moon in the skies above Tlaxtlan their powers waned, as the mone is comprised of pure Chaos and did not obey the laws of the universe, which governed the original moons orbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ct_xlanhuapec_desc;Xlanhuapec, known as the City of the Mists, was the second city-temple to be built. It is perpetually shrouded in thick mist, so much so one can travel through the entirety of the city without realizing of its existance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ca_tlanqua_desc;Tlaqua has survived isolated from the inland Lizardmen outposts of the Southlands.

The largest of the pyramids still dominate over the rest of the city thanks to the undying efforts of the Liche Priests tasked with slowly restoring the cities monuments.

The city itself is difficult for invading armies to approach, protected from the west by mountains, east by the dangerous waters of the Gulf of Fear and south by the Cursed Jungle.

Even with Nagash's curse, these nobles and priests defend their masters and to their bidding when commanded. Heavily armed and armored, these troops are much more threatening then the regular hosts of the Tomb Kings.;;;;;;;;x
tp_lichemortuary_1_desc;While the Liche-priests are tasked with upkeeping the undead Nehekharan servants, they also have the job of assembling the monstrous statues fielded by Tomb Kings.

What might have once been a clean, brightly colored and highly decorated wall is now covered in sand and dust, and decayed from the millenia these walls have had to endure. While they may be old, these wall should not be mistaken for being weak and ready to collapse, for much like the pyramids, these cities were built to stand the test of time.;;;;;;;;x

Much of what they once were is forgotten of course, but they well remember the ways of war and obedience. Most of the time they are sleeping in great tombs where they were buried to protect their master in the afterlife, but they are often awoken by the Liche Priests when commanded by the Tomb Kings to prepare for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

A sonorous call will spread, drawing Chaos Warriors and fell beasts to its source.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_2;Ruinous Altar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_2_desc;The Dark Gods' omnipresence in the reaches of the north mean men who carve out an existence there are devout indeed. To the Northmen, the favour of their Gods is a vital and glorious part of their lives. A Northman communes with his deities directly, whether upon a Ruinous Altar or not. They dedicate their body and soul to the Gods, rather than offering petty prayers at the behest of sanctimonious priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_3;Chaos Warshrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_4;Chaos Warshrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_3_desc;Prayers and sacrifices offered from Warshrines are like sweet nectar to the otherworldly beings that reside within the Realm of Chaos. The very air crackles with power around each shrine when the eyes of the Gods turn their way. The presence of altars empowers and emboldens the Chaos Warriors fighting before them, drawing only the very best into their radiance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_5;Arcane Vortex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_5_desc;Often taking the form of a cracked ring partially buried in the ground and covered with dark runes, an arcane vortex is surely a mystery to mortals, even those not blissfully ignorant of the Dark Powers that reside in the north. What spill forth from the vortex are nightmare things and the occasional Chaos Sorcerer, sent as an emissary of the Chaos Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_6;Chaos Rift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaosgodstemple_6_desc;If the summoning or the glorifying act is strong enough, if the emotions of the summoner run hot and desperate, then a tear in the material realm can be made - a direct portal into the Realm of Chaos. For a mortal to stare into such a portal is to invite utter insanity, but what comes through it is the true threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_1;Palanquin of Trophies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_2;Palanquin of Trophies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_1_desc;Some roving bands of Chaos Knights will insist that their victims' skulls, bones and trinkets are collected in the aftermath of a battle. They are piled onto a palanquin by familiars and minions as testament to the Chaos Knights' abilities. Should a patron God look down and see this tribute, then he may be pleased and bless his servants with the gifts of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_3;Pillar of Skulls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_4;Pillar of Skulls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_2_desc;Pillars of skulls are not uncommon in the wastes close to the Realm of Chaos. They are said to be the bounty of the Chaos Knights, their many victims impaled on blackened lances, their souls sent to the Chaos Gods in payment for Chaos Armour and fell steeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_5;Mound of Blades;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_3_desc;In the tribal warbands of Chaos Warriors, customs and traditions are few and far between. Yet, one practice does seem appear to take place. To take a weapon from the mound of blades a Chaos Warrior must first place another upon it. The offered weapon cannot be his own, it must be taken from the corpse of a sworn foe. The rare few who forswear this custom discover at their cost that this is one tradition that the Chaos Gods seem to appreciate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_6;Reliquary of Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_chaostrophies_4_desc;Reliquaries are unholy stores of a Warband's most treasured weapons. It is true that champions keep their most prized accoutrements on their person at all times, but for those lucky enough to acquire a fine blade or ensorcelled axe, a reliquary will keep it safe from rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tb_steppe_hold_1;Tribal Gathering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_1_desc;Although not tribes in the same sense as the Northmen, Chaos Warriors band together according to affiliations in their previous lives and, of course, their patron deities. Even those Warriors that worship Chaos undivided still have their own tribal connections, so band together to await the rise of Great Champion - a King with three eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_2;Fortified Encampment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_2_desc;The Warriors of Chaos have no need of food and sleep, for they are imbued with power from the Chaos Gods and sustenance is a mortal concern. The iron-bound men make camp together to form bonds, warbands and worship their fell, Ruinous masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_3;Unholy Legion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_steppe_hold_3_desc;Due to the nature of the Chaos Wastes, tribes must be mobile in order to avoid being swallowed whole by the unpredictable threats that sometimes tear into reality. Simple yet effective, these yurts are where the rulers of the north dwell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

These monsters can capsize ships and swallow hundreds of men in a single gulp. Thus, Whalers must be made of sterner stuff than ordinary fishermen;;;;;;;;;x

ca_miragliano;Miragliano;;;;;;;;;x
ca_miragliano_desc;One of the mightiest city-states of Tilea, Miragliano is always assailed by the plagues and insidious ratmen coming from the Blighted Marshes to its west. As a result, the city itself is highly fortified, with walls specially designed to give maximum advantage to artillery firing from it, and towers that never crumble even when leaning at near-comical angles. These excellently planned fortifications are the results of the sponsorship of engineering, science and other arts by the Princes of Miragliano. Thus, it is not surprise that this was the city to give birth to the genius inventor and engineer, Leonardo da Miragliano.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_remas;Remas;;;;;;;;;x
ct_remas_desc;Remas is the greatest and most ancient city in Tilea. It is home to a huge circular port, said to have been built when the city was still a High Elf trading post, and even in the ruined and dilapidated state it is now, it still houses the powerful Reman fleet. A great bridge links the city proper to the port, and also houses many businesses and the fine palaces of the merchant princes. Remas proper is laid out on a grand scale within a long circuit of defenses, and protected by mercenary companies of pikemen that fight in the ancient style.;;;;;;;;;x

In more recent times the explorer Marco Colombo installed himself as Prince and wisely invested Lustrian treasure in the city. What next for Trantio?;;;;;;;;;x

Not just from the Orks of the badlands, or Goblins from the mountains, but from the inummerable Beastman tribes that inhabit the foreboding Stygian Woods. Due to this, Akendorf is considered the weakest between Khypris and Myrmidens.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_castellumos_1_desc;The Castellumos, or 'Castle' in Myken, is the military center for the region, housing most of a Myken lord's levies and retinues, as well as some servants. Due to the increasing in Tilean pressure on the Mykens, many Castellumoi employ large amounts of artisans or philosophers, adopting and melding the Tilean and Myken arts together into a fascinating blend.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_akritai_archers_1_desc;The Akritai are the main skirmishing force for the Myken armies, equipped with javelins, crossbows, and sometimes even long bows. Like most Myken soldiery, these troops are professional soldiers, with paid saleries and terms for service, most signing a 5 year term, with the chance of either retiring after or continuing service and being promoted to a more prestigious rank. Akritai however, are much more loose in this regard, and many are Game wardens or hunters during times of peace, giving them an edge in the dark woods of Stygia or in the scorching heat of the badlands.;;;;;;;;;x

Like the Akritai and Excubitoroi, they have paid saleries and terms for service, but unlike the Akritai, it is not uncommon for Comitoi to be rewared small plots of land in return for their services in war, in addition to their saleries, making them stubborn defenders that do not retreat easily.;;;;;;;;;x

These guards are the highest in the Myken tier system, and many are either minor nobles or wealthy merchant sons looking for honor and glory, or, in the case of the captains of the guard, the lord or lady's ear. Heavily armoured, incredibly disciplined, these riders make quick work of any Orkish or Beastman horde that dares to encroach upon a Myken's land.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_myken_city_1_desc;A Myken city is an intriqueing sight to behold for any traveller visitng the Borderlands. In stark contrast between the grim outlook of many minor villages and forts in the area, Myken cities are centers of trade, science, and philosophy, attracting many to their centers and increasing the power that each city wields, many of which could be rivalling city states, if not for the constant Ork or Beastman threat. Due to the increased cultural pressures from Tilea, many Myken cities are adopting and melding the modern look of a Tilean city with the ancient splendours of the old Myken cities.;;;;;;;;;x

Many nobles and merchants send their sons to these establishments, universities specializing in the fine arts, engineering, and the art of war. Such a quality education is not cheap, however...;;;;;;;;;x

It was Dazh who took the secret of flame from the sun and gave it to the ancient warrior chiefs of the tribesmen.

tp_wise_women_2;Wise Women;;;;;;;;x
tp_wise_women_desc;The people of Kislev are a superstitious folk, and those that ministrate such superstition within a settlement are known by the Ungol tribes collectively as Wise Women. These Wise Women are an ancient tradition of magicians that still survives among the Ungols tribes, and their influence extends even to the Gospodars. The wise women keep the oral lore of the tribes, mediate with the spirits of the steppe, and keep a vigilant eye out for the taint of Chaos. Naturally, everyone hates them. That is, of course, a slight exaggeration, but no where are the wise women, or the hags, actually popular. Wise women know much of the history of the Ungol tribes and of their dealings with the creatures of the steppes. They use this knowledge to help the tribe. In some areas, the ability to recollect such information might make them popular, but on the northern steppes of Kislev, their knowledge consists almost entirely of past disasters and the depredations of the servants of the Ruinous Powers. Thus, their advice almost always consists of telling people they cannot do things that look like a good idea. That valley might look sheltered and fertile, but it was home to a cult that bound Daemons. Travelling south with the horses might earn a fortune, but if the rota does not perform a particular ritual, then the ghosts of a raiding band of Kurgan will be freed to come after them. And so on.;;;;;;;;x

#ca_al_haikk_desc;Al-Haikk is traditionally the capital of Araby, whenever the nation is united. Once known as the ?Jewel of Araby?, the city has declined importance in recent years, with continued wars, disasters and sieges targeting it due its source of legitimacy as the seat of the Great Sultan of All-Araby. While it?s usually called the ?City of Thieves? nowadays, due to the rampant depopulation ? and thievery ? in some of its old quarters, and overshadowed by other thriving rival cities, it remains a prestigious location to all Arabyans.;;;;;;;;;x
#tp_chaos_dwarf_ziggurat_walls_1_desc;The thick outer walls of a Chaos Dwarf Ziggurat are made out of the same dark obsidian as the rest of the structure. While common obsidian is known to be brittle, the Dawi Zharr have perfected their obsidian bricks into a strong material, thanks to their magical skill, alchemy and other darker, sorcerous secrets. As such, these towering walls strike an imposing visage amongst the enemies ? and slaves ? of the Chaos Dwarfs.;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_impcastle_1_desc;While most Human architecture cannot compete with those of the elder races, the Imperials can say with pride that theirs are fairly close to dwarf stock. Elegant, yet intimidating, Imperial castles are normally situated on points of strategic importance, such as river forks or high Plateaus. Like Tilean palaces of the south, Imperial castles have a small cadre of artists, scientists, and engineers to upkeep the castle.;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_imptown_1_desc;Like their Bretonnian counterparts, Imperial castles will normally have villages and hamlets outside their walls, for the castle can provide some safety to the villagers below. Unlike their Bretonnian counterparts, however, is that these villagers can move around freely, stimulating trade and spreading new ideas throughout the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_nuln_artillery_foundry_desc;The grand city of Nuln is the centre of production for blackpowder weapons and accessories in the Empire with even many dwarfs taking up residence here to lend a hand in both producing and designing many of these weapons.;;;;;;;;;x

#ct_druchiimarketplace_1_desc;The great slave markets of the Druchii are places of pain and depravity, where the master's leash cuts deep and the very air thick with malice. Here, slaves are corraled into various stocks and pens, awaiting their fates, weither it be to die toiling in mines, dying in battle, or worse yet, becoming another plaything for their new Druchii masters.;;;;;;;;;x
#tr_alddrakkbar_1_desc;The Ald-Drakk-Bar are a series of ancient fortifications locaed in the Norscan mountains. Likely built by the original Dwarf settlers when they first arrived in Norsca, these gates protect choke-points and important holds from harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_norscan_stables_1_desc;Norscans are not known to field cavalry, instead relying upon mercenaries from their more northerly brethren to fill the gaps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#ca_tilean_keep_1_desc;The main keeps of Tilean fortresses are usually ostentatious palaces built by its myriad of Princes. While they lack the typical garrison of armoured footmen and free riders of other realms, they make up with a veritable army of philosophers, painters, sculptors and other polymaths seeking patronage, who make the abodes of Tliean princes into true cultural ? and financial - centers.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_halfling_great_1;Great Militia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_halfling_great_1_desc;Rather than forcing Halflings into long, brunchless days of training, it is possible to simply drag as many as possible from their homes at the time of crisis.

tp_hotpot_1_desc;The Hot-Pie Catapult is an intersting Halfling invention, made out of desperation by a Halfling cook when he came under attack by a Goblin force. He would eventually win the battle, in thanks to his makeshift artillery units that fired incredibly hot pies at the goblins, which proved to be surprisingly effective against them. Ever since the battle, the temples and shrines to Esmeralda always have a small number of these catapults, in case they come under attack.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_sollander_1_desc;Long ago, before Solland was destroyed by the hands of Greenskins, Solland was a well respected Elector-County, rich and powerful due to their trade from the south. But, with Solland destroyed, many of the displaced nobles donned black armor and began forming into what they called Black Rider companies. They assist Sollanders whenever they can, and are a feared fighting force in the field.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_stirlander_4;Stirlander Free Companies;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirlander_1_desc;Stirland is a county deeply rooted in tradition and superstition, believing completely in the age old saying 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. This is mirrored in their free companies, who are stubborn attackers and defenders in any situation.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_stirlander2_2;Death Watch;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirlander2_3;Death Watch;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirlander2_4;Death Watch;;;;;;;;;x

ca_stirlander3_3;Stirlander Hunters;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirlander3_4;Stirlander Hunters;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirlander3_1_desc;Stirland is a poor and barbaric land, unsuitable for farming and trading.

ca_talabeclander_1_desc;Talabecland is a realm that is swallowed whole by the Great Forest, the largest of five great forests in the Empire. Like all of the forests, it harbors untold amounts of bandits, Greenskins, Beastmen, and even sometimes Chaos warriors should an invasion fail. Due to this, Talabecland has formed an elite archer unit comprised of the local hunters, tasked with hunting and exterminating any dark threats that lurk in the shadows of the Great Forests of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_talabeclander2_4;Coaching Inn;;;;;;;;;x
ca_talabeclander2_1_desc;While the Empire continues to try and contain the vast forests that grow within it's borders, it is sometimes neglectful of it's roads that criss-cross the entirety of the Empire. Traveling the Empire in good times can take weeks, especially going through Woodland Roads. Due to the sheer amount of danger inhabiting these forests, stopping to rest in the middle of nowhever is impracticle, so the Elector-Counties-Talabecland especially- have established fortified coaching inns along the roads for merchants and travellers to rest in safety.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_talabeclander3_1_desc;Thanks to Talabecland being almost completely consumed by the Great Forest, logging has become a norm in the Elector-County. While it provides money and supplies to the county, it isn't exactly a safe job, with bandits, Greenskins, and even Beastmen roaming the dark places of the forest, so each lumberjack is skilled in the use of a bow-and-arrow, and can be levied in times of war to support the militia of Talabecland.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_drakwalder_1_desc;Drakwald is a harsh, and unforgiving land, it's people tempered by the forest, and long remember their ancestors, the Thuringians.

ca_nordlander_1_desc;The Nordland, much like all counties in the north of the Empire, is a hard land, with the only constants being strife and death. While it does not have to bear the brunt of Chaos incursions, it is constantly pillaged and raided by the Norscans. But not all of them leave, as some settle down in the Nordland, bringing with them their belongings and traditions, of which the Nordland has adopted in the form of it's Warbands and Beserkers. High on some fort of shrooms and bloodlust, Beserkers throw themselves willingly into the frey with little regard for safety, carving bloody swaths into enemy formations.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_nordlander3_1_desc;The Nordland, while sparsly populated, is home to not only Imperials, but Norscans as well that have been permitted to settle in the county. Due to this mix of cultures, Nordland does not field 'militias' but instead raises warbands, semi-professional soldiers that serve terms. Undisciple and barbaric, these soldiers are much more aggressive than their southern counterparts, but can be relied upon to hold a line or crush the enemy lines.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_sylvanian_1_desc;The Desperate Sons are Sylvania's 'free companies'. With Sylvania being a poor and backward county, these free companies are truly a desperate lot, more often not even being able to afford the proper uniform, let alone weapons. But what they don't have in weapons and armor, they make up for in spirit, for they have lived all their lives in the cursed lands of Sylvania, they have nothing to fear.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_ostermarker_1_desc;Ostermark is the northern most county in the Empire, sitting above Sylvania and to the east of Ostland and Hochland.
