ca_altdorf;Altdorf;;;;;;;;;x
ca_altdorf_desc; Altdorf is one of the oldest cities in the Empire, one of the and arguably its grandest, dating its foundations back to the time of Sigmar himself. Within the city's Dwarf built walls, establishments like the School of Engineers and the Cult of Sigmar conduct their day to day business protected by one of the most well equipped and trained armies in the Empire. Thanks to the city's vast wealth, it has profited from acting as one of the foremost centres of trade in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_middenheim;Middenheim;;;;;;;;;x
ca_middenheim_desc;Built upon a five hundred feet pinnacle of rock, Middenheim is the capital of the Imperial province of Middenland and one of the greatest fortress-cities in the realms of man, second only to Altdorf in size and influence. It is also home to the Cult of Ulric whose loyal followers would sacrifice their lives for defence of the city, the most fearsome being the legendary Knights of the White Wolf who would utterly dedicate themselves to the city's defence in a time of need.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nuln;Nuln;;;;;;;;;x
ca_nuln_desc;Nuln is both a spiritual and technological centre for the people of the Empire. Along with Altdorf, Nuln holds the second seat for one of the two Arch-Lectors of the Cult of Sigmar. The technological side to Nuln comes from its long and distinguished trade with the Dwarf holds, under whose expert guidance has allowed the engineers of the city to produce some of the best blackpowder weaponry in the Empire and the finest artillery crews.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marienburg;Marienburg;;;;;;;;;x
ca_marienburg_desc;The great city of Marienburg is the largest and most prosperous trading city in the entire Old World. Its wealth flows in from all corners of the world, no other city houses merchants from Ulthuan next door to those from far off Cathay like Marienburg. Due to this, the city enjoys a rich cultural mix which can be seen even among the local merchants who are renowned for their flamboyant ways.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_talabheim;Talabheim;;;;;;;;;x
ca_talabheim_desc;Located in the centre of a vast crater, Talabheim is the capital of Talabecland and serves to continually watch over the darkness of the Great Forest that covers the region. The city itself struggles to cover much of the crater, allowing farms to exist with its rocky walls which ensure a steady stream of supplies during sieges, only adding to the impregnability of the city. With the rims of the crater fortified and two large fortresses placed at its only entrances, Talabheim is truly a beacon of safety for poor souls travelling along the Old Forest Road and so has allowed the city to function as the main centre of trade in the area.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_drakenhof;Drakenhof Castle;;;;;;;;;x
ca_drakenhof_desc;Castle Drakenhof is situated on the peak of high clifftop from where it casts it's dark gaze over the blighted lands of Sylvania. The citadel was cursed even before Vlad von Carstein's arrival and made it his home, an event which would further damn Sylvania in the annals of history.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_averheim;Averheim;;;;;;;;;x
ca_averheim_desc; Lying on the banks of the river Aver, the city of Averheim is the capital of the southern region of Averland. At the centre of this prosperous city sits the impressive keep of Averburg where the Elector Count takes up residence, safe in the knowledge that it has never fallen to an invading army. The fertile region of Averland is famed for its cattle and so during the warm summers it is common to see the stockyards surrounding Averheim to be filled with cattle merchants and their livestock, sometimes even crowding the streets within the city itself, a fact which has led to Averlanders and their cattle being the joke of Imperials from other provinces.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hergig;Hergig;;;;;;;;;x
ca_hergig_desc; Hergig is the heavily defended capital of the sparsely populated province of Hochland. Despite being covered by both the Drakwald Forest and the equally as dangerous Forest of Shadows, Hochland has surprisingly managed to remain resilient against the constant threat of Beastmen, Forest Goblins and other dark horrors lurking in the forests. This is mainly due to its highly skilled state troops who tirelessly patrol the forest. Due to many Hochlanders being trained hunters and marksmen, their state troops contain an abundance of archers and handgunners, the best of which are armed with the highly accurate Hochland long rifle, a weapon that has earned a fearsome reputation among the Empire's foes.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfenburg;Wolfenburg;;;;;;;;;x
ca_wolfenburg_desc;The people of Ostland can best be described by the provinces symbol of the bull. Stubborn and resolute, Ostlanders are a hardy folk as one would imagine given how close they live to the Chaos realms of the north. Due to this fact of life, Ostlanders are prone to a life of almost constant drinking with some even spending most of their lives intoxicated as a way of boosting their courage to deal with the harsh world around them. The city of Wolfenburg has long been a bulwark against the threats coming from outside the Empire and from within, even if the rest of Ostland has fallen, Wolfenburg will stand strong until the end.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirland;Wurtbad;;;;;;;;;x
ca_stirland_desc;Wurtbad is the capital of Stirland, a rural and poor region in the Empire. Stirland has maintained a reputation amongst other Imperials of being a rural backwater despite the many large towns that dot the countryside. Part of this is due however to the nature of Stirlanders themselves who are for the most part a conservative and superstitious folk who have remained hostile to outsiders, something which becomes understandable given their close proximity to the cursed land of Sylvania. The armies of Stirland represent the poor nature of their region with most state troops not even able to afford a proper green and yellow uniform, carrying a small token of their region instead. It would be a foolish mistake to take this poverty as a sign of weakness as soldiers from Stirland are just as devoted and brave as other Imperial soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_olricstaad;Ulric's Throat;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_olricstaad_desc;Ulric's Throat is the entrance to a vast cave system linking together the strongholds of the Order of the Winter Throne, the Ragnarites, a monastic order dedicated to an aspect Ulric known as the Snow King. The caves provide protection from the hostile Norscan winters and attackers alike, and are rumored to safeguard the Throne of the Winter King, an Ulrican holy artifact of unknown power. The order's members believe that it is their duty to prepare for the Evernacht, the eternal winter that Ulric will call upon to defeat the Dark Gods, ensuring their caves are always well provisioned with food, weapons, and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ulfsland;Ulfsland;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ulfsland_desc;Named after legendary hero Ulf Donnersson from the sagas of the Skaelings, it was told that after discovering the island that bears his name, he was made to complete trials of strength and endurance against a miraculously able old man. In the sagas, when Ulf won the trials, the bested old man turned out to be the god Ulric himself, who blessed Ulf and his descendants with the land as a reward for his skill and devotion. Ulfsland remains an important place as the spiritual home of the Skaelings, as well as a center of Norse political and spiritual life, even if many tribes have moved away from the worship of Ulric.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_manann_centre;The Great Temple of Manann;;;;;;;;x
tp_manann_centre_desc;The centre of the Manannite Cult is Marienburg. Much of the cult's fabulous wealth flows to the Great Temple, giving the high priests significant temporal power and prestige.;;;;;;;;x
tp_sacred_flame;The Sacred Flame of Ulric;;;;;;;;x
tp_sacred_flame_desc;Middenheim is home to the Great Temple of Ulric. The centre of the Cult's worship is the sacred flame, but the temple is more fortress than shrine. Its immensely strong walls shelter a vast army of Ulrican templars, all willing to fight and die at the order of the Ar-Ulric.;;;;;;;;x
#
# THE MOOT
#
ca_grandmoot;Eicheschatten;;;;;;;;x
ca_grandmoot_desc;Unlike the other capitals of the Empire, Eicheschatten is a humble but exceedingly comfortable town, well-suited to the Halfling race. Every three years, a General Moot of all Halflings gathers here to choose a new Elder and decide on matters of Halfling justice.;;;;;;;;x
ca_three_smoke_rings;The Three Smoke Rings;;;;;;;;x
ca_three_smoke_rings_desc;Most of the Mootland's tobacco is produced in Gipfel. Although this sleepy town is small enough that its main tavern, the Three Smoke Rings, also doubles as a government building, but its population is swollen by traders from across the Old World during harvest time.;;;;;;;;x
ca_sauerapfel;Sauerapfel;;;;;;;;x
ca_sauerapfel_desc;Sauerapfel is the main port of the Mootland. Many of its inhabitants are outward-looking "adventuring Halflings", and even those who stay in town think of themselves as more sophisticated than other Mootlanders. This attitude wins them few friends elsewhere in the Moot!;;;;;;;;x

ca_impcastle_1_desc;While most human architecture cannot compete with that of the elder races, the sons of sigmar can say with pride that theirs are fairly close to dwarf stock. Elegant, yet intimidating, Imperial castles are normally situated on points of strategic importance, such as river forks or high Plateaus. Like Tilean palaces of the south, Imperial castles often attract a small cadre of artists, scientists, and engineers.;;;;;;;;;x

tp_grail_chapel_desc;Bretonnia is dotted with Grail Chapels. These shrines commemorate places where the Lady of the Lake has appeared to her faithful and are most often the sites at which a Knight drank from the Grail and joined Bretonnia's holiest order.

tb_black_crag_desc;Black Crag, or Karak Drazh in Khazalid, is the largest and most well known Greenskin stronghold in the world. When the Dwarfs still held the Black Crag, it provided a strong defensable position in the south of the Worlds Edge mountains, and was also a very rich hold. It would survive the Time of Woes, but would fall shortly after to Greenskins, turning the once great hold into a scar on the Dwarfs honor and history.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_khypris_desc;Khypris, the city of splendours, is a massive trade city located in the borderlands, once the capital of the grand Khyprote empire in ages past. While the empire is long gone from most human memory, the power and prestige of the city remains, and as such is considered the greatest city between Myrmidens and Akendorf.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_akendorf;Akendorf;;;;;;;;;x
ca_akendorf_desc;Akendorf, once the captial of a long lost Imperial borderlands Elector-County, is the center of all Imperial influence in the borderlands, straddeling the boundry of what the Imperials consider the 'civilized' world, it is a city that is constantly under threat. Not just from the Orks of the badlands, or Goblins from the mountains, but from the inummerable Beastman tribes that inhabit the foreboding Stygian Woods. Due to this, Akendorf is considered the weakest between Khypris and Myrmidens.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_myrmidens;Myrmidens;;;;;;;;;x
ca_myrmidens_desc;Myrmidens is the second largest city-state in the Borderlands, capital of the Aegean Principality, one of the sucessor states of the Myrmidan Empire. The days of Myrmidias' Empire are long gone, but the proud and civic traditions it left behind are still strong, reflected in Myrmidens' strong, yet elegant walls, designed to impress and intimidate would-be conquerors and foreign diplomats. Dealings with Dwarf holds have increased Myrmidens' importance not only as a trading hub, but also as a technological and military center, as both Human and Dwarf work closely with each other to stamp out the Greenskin threat to the south.;;;;;;;;;x

Located on the southern shore of the peninsula, it's one of the main trading ports of the Southern Seas. Magritta maintains a strong maritime presence here, and aggressively patrols its waters against Sartosan pirates, Arabyan corsairs and, while at it, imposes a "toll" on foreign ships moving through its territory. It is also the home of the Archecclesiatium, the main temple of the Cult of Myrmidia.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bilbali;Bilbali;;;;;;;;;x
ct_bilbali_desc;Bilbali is, in many ways, a stark contrast to its southern rival, Magritta. Where Margitta's climate is warm and bright, Bilbali is always covered in rain and fog. While Magritta's golden shores are bathed by the temperate waters of the Southern Seas, the waves of the Great Ocean clash against the rocky cliffs of Bilbali. This is noticeable even their produce, as Bilbali's main export is the weaponry in their military arsenals and gunpowder refineries. It also acts as a trading hub between Lustria and the Old World, and the city is unusually welcoming of Bretonnian merchants ( For an Estalian city, that is ).;;;;;;;;;x

#
ca_miragliano;Miragliano;;;;;;;;;x
ca_miragliano_desc;One of the mightiest city-states of Tilea, Miragliano is always assailed by the plagues and insidious ratmen coming from the Blighted Marshes to its west. As a result, the city itself is highly fortified, with walls specially designed to give maximum advantage to artillery firing from it, and towers that never crumble even when leaning at near-comical angles. These excellently planned fortifications are the results of the sponsorship of engineering, science and other arts by the Princes of Miragliano. Thus, it is not surprise that this was the city to give birth to the genius inventor and engineer, Leonardo da Miragliano.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_remas;Remas;;;;;;;;;x
ct_remas_desc;Remas is the greatest and most ancient city in Tilea. It is home to a huge circular port, said to have been built when the city was still a High Elf trading post, and even in the ruined and dilapidated state it is now, it still houses the powerful Reman fleet. A great bridge links the city proper to the port, and also houses many businesses and the fine palaces of the merchant princes. Remas proper is laid out on a grand scale within a long circuit of defenses, and protected by mercenary companies of pikemen that fight in the ancient style.;;;;;;;;;x

While an inventor's guildhouse can produce anything from fine arts to near-magical armors and weapons, the most popular for the militaristic Tilean cities is the cannonsmithies. Those who produce these cannons can make the finest cannons made by Mannish hands, although they are quite haughty and prideful, and thus will not establish a guildhouse should the condottieri already be set up in a city.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_ballistarii_1_desc;The Ballistarii are crossbow wielding heavy skirmisher troops designed to kill other skirmisher and heavy infantry formations with their powerful siege crossbows. Due to the close relationship between the Mykens and the Dwarves, the Ballistarii's crossbows are of superior make compared to the Estalian or Tilean models, easily puncturing plate mail and in some cases being forceful enough to pass through multiple targets.;;;;;;;;;x

In stark contrast between the grim outlook of many minor villages and forts in the area, Myken cities are centers of trade, science, and philosophy, attracting many to their centers and increasing the power that each city wields, many of which could be rivalling city states, if not for the constant Ork or Beastman threat. Due to the increased cultural pressures from Tilea, many Myken cities are adopting and melding the modern look of a Tilean city with the ancient splendours of the old Myken cities.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_al_haikk_desc;Al-Haikk is traditionally the capital of Araby, whenever the nation is united. Once known as the "Jewel of Araby"??, the city has declined importance in recent years, with continued wars, disasters and sieges targeting it due its source of legitimacy as the seat of the Great Sultan of All-Araby. While it's usually called the "City of Thieves"?? nowadays, due to the rampant depopulation - and thievery - in some of its old quarters, and overshadowed by other thriving rival cities, it remains a prestigious location to all Arabyans.;;;;;;;;;x

While the Ksar is the military might of the Arabyans, their architecture is legendary, full of impossible shapes, domed-roof buildings, and a myriad of spires, all linked with small walkways to get to-and-from. This not only serves to appease foreign emissaries, but to provide a confusing, maze-like structure, making it difficult for invaders to successfully take an Arabyan settlement.;;;;;;;;;x

Unlike the Shushtar, who use mounted archery and harass tactics, the Shariati make use of the sturdy Arabyan camel to deliver devastating charges unto enemy lines. It is also known that foreign horses(those that are not native to Araby) are afraid of camels due to their smell, and so the camel cavalry was also initially the reason for many Arabyan victories during the crusades.;;;;;;;;;x

Though, due to the nature of Sartosan cities, these markets are not as prosperous as their Imperial, Tilean, or Asur counterparts, as Sartosan society revolves around the sea and pillaging others to sate their needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_couronne;Couronne;;;;;;;;;x
ca_couronne_desc;The traditional capital of Bretonnia, Couronne is a large sprawling city heavily protected by a formidable series of bastions and towers spread out over the high walls. At the centre of the city lies the king's palace, a large citadel which allows the monarch to observe the lowly peasants beneath them from a safe distance. The city of Couronne also stands out for being one of the few clean cities in Bretonnia, something it owes to the great temple of Shallya and to the natural springs which can be found throughout the city.It is commonly said that the people of Couronne are born in the saddle, an exaggeration but one that holds some element of truth as the Couronnians are famed throughout the land as experts on equine matters. Other Bretonnians would call them obsessed with horses but even they cannot question the fine skill of Couronnian horsemen.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_languille;L'Anguille;;;;;;;;;x
ca_languille_desc;First established by the High Elves as a trading port, the city of L'Anguille is truly one of the wonders of the Old World and still one of the main trading ports. The most obvious landmark in the city is that of the three-hundred feet tall lighthouse and the high walls that extend from it to surround the city. Both walls and lighthouse were constructed by the Elves and so bear the familiar signs of their fine craftsmanship which stands in stark contrast to the more recent and human built buildings within the walls. The oldest of the buildings inside the walls is castle itself which is located on a small island in the middle of the harbour, commanding the entire bay with its impressive defences.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_brionne;Brionne;;;;;;;;;x
ca_brionne_desc;Much like the other cities in the dukedom, Brionne is a city based around beauty rather than practicality. Nevertheless, the castle at the heart of the city remains a surprisingly well-defended fortress despite its beautiful exterior. The entire city is set upon a hilly peninsula that is only joint to the mainland through a narrow and easily defended neck, the land around forming a natural harbour. Due to the regions strategic position, the Dukes of Brionne are tasked with maintaining a fleet of warships to patrol the southern coast from whomever would disturb the realm.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lyonesse;Castle Lyonesse;;;;;;;;;x
ca_lyonesse_desc;Castle Lyonesse is located on the north-west coast of Bretonnia, built upon a large island just off the mainland. As a result of this naturally defensive position, the castle is heavily fortified both by its natural defenses and those established by the Duke such as the huge keep at the peak of the island. At the high tide it is possible for small boats to sail right up into the outer courtyards whilst at low tide the sea sweeps back revealing ruins on the sea bed, thus any invading army must time their attack to avoid being stuck in either the high or low tides.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_montfort;Montfort;;;;;;;;;x
ca_montfort_desc;The castle and town of Montfort are located on the Bretonnian side of the Axe Bite Pass, a crucial defensive location against both greenskins attacking from the grey mountains as well as the Empire, a realm with whom Bretonnia has been at war with just as much as they have allied with. Due to this strategic location, Montfort Castle is one of the best human constructed fortification in the Old World. Spreading out from the massive keep are five tiers of giant sixty feet walls which have been firmly constructed into the rock itself, protecting the large town of Montfort from any hostile invaders. Naturally the Bretonnians here have decided that their hard work has earned them the right to exact heavy tolls on merchants or any other traveller that braves the dangerous but utterly important pass. Ironically and in a true Bretonnian fashion, this also includes the towns own citizens who pay much in order to gain access to the inner sections of Montfort.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_parravon;Parravon;;;;;;;;;x
ca_parravon_desc;The impressive Bretonnian city of Parravon has been carved directly into the living rock from an outcrop of the Grey Mountains. Castle Parravon dominates the stunning city below from its high vantage point at the peak of the outcrop, tunnels stretching far down into the heart of the mountain further increasing its defensive capabilities. Parravon is also famous for its Pegasus Knights as the noble creatures themselves can be found in the nearby section of the Grey Mountains more so than anywhere else in Bretonnia.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_artois;Artois;;;;;;;;;x
ca_artois_desc;Built in the midst of the beastmen infested Forest of Arden, Castle Artois is a well-fortified keep that has withstood its share of battles. The castle's real focus however is around providing safe accommodation for the Duke and his many mounted warriors, yeoman and knights alike, who ride out on endless hunts against the beastmen of the forest.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bordeleaux;Bordeleaux;;;;;;;;;x
ca_bordeleaux_desc;The bustling port of Bordeleaux holds much in common with many of the other major ports in Bretonnia being built off of ancient Elven ruins from the time long ago where they lorded over this land. The mighty castle of the Duke rests atop a cliff that rises over the main harbour, the countless siege weapons on its walls being able to reach any point in the city and the bay. Over the years, Bordeleaux has found itself in an ongoing commercial rivalry between itself and the great northern port of L'Anguille, a rivalry that Bordeleaux has always been on the losing end of.;;;;;;;;;x,
ca_gisoreux;Gisoreux;;;;;;;;;x
ca_gisoreux_desc;The city of Gisoreux is a bustling city filled with merchants and travellers from all across the Old World with it even being said that there are more Imperial traders in Gisoreux than any other city in Bretonnia. The massive bulk of Castle Gisoreux dominates the entire city, a single curtain wall runs for well over a mile long, enclosing two large keeps that provide accommodation and protection for many of the local dignitaries.;;;;;;;;;x

Supposedly, this is so that the lords in charge of the fortresses can better aid and protect the peasants living in their land, as is their duty, but it's more commonly used to protect just the lord, and his own family and possessions, while the peasants have to fare for themselves. Typically, none of the lowborn men-at-arms and free riders are admitted inside, though Bretonnian lords commonly use the empty space to store more weapons and armor to better arm their peasants levies with.;;;;;;;;;x

ct_bretonnianmarketplace_1_desc;Due to Bretonnia's highly feudalized government and traditions, everyone that is not of noble birth belongs to a noble, with each noble being granted an estate which houses a number of serfs, retinues, and goods. In times of peace, the serfs tend to the noble's fields and the retinues keep a vigilant eye on the surronding lands, patrolling endlessly for malevolent forces. In times of war, a good many of the noble's serfs are levied into his or her's armies, and the retinues are folded into the core knightly units of the noble's army.;;;;;;;;;x

Here, Yeomen, both mounted and on foot are practice with their bows and longbows day in and day out. Yeomen are still peasants, so they cannot be trusted to stay on the field if things get hairy, but they can easily harass slower moving targets and deal damage to lightly armored targets.;;;;;;;;;x

Not only this, but most serfs are forced to accompany their liege to said jousting grounds, forcing some trade between the peasantry of Bretonnia, a rare occurance in most cases.;;;;;;;;;x

Due to the peasants being barred from worshipping the Grails, no peasant soldiers can be found inside the halls of the monastery.

ca_karak_eightpeaks;Karak Eight Peaks;;;;;;;;;x
ca_karak_eightpeaks_desc;Karak Eight Peaks, also known as Vala-Azril-Ungol ( "Queen of the Silver Depths" in Khazalid ), was one of the greatest Dwarf holds, rivaling even Karaz-a-Karak in size and power. It was located in a great bowl-shaped valley, ringed by eight high peaks. Above the surface, walls encompassed a vast area, but most of the city was built below ground. Below the earth, the city was a made up of courts and plazas with great vaulted ceilings, and further below, the tombs of the Dwarf kings and deep mines. Its fall to a combined Skaven-Night Goblin invasion meant the end of the Dwarf Golden Age. Since then, many a member of Clan Angrund has tried to reclaim their ancestral homeland from the vermin infesting it, unsuccessfully..;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slayer_keep;Slayer Keep;;;;;;;;;x
ca_slayer_keep_desc;Karak Kadrin, otherwise known as "Slayer Keep", is a mighty Dwarf hold that has guarded one of the few major passes through World's Edge Mountains, the peak pass. For countless centuries this hold has guarded the lands of Kislev and the Empire to west against greenskin threats and worse. The hold is home to the Shrine of Grimnir and is a sacred place for all would-be Slayers. The hold also has a long history of Slayer Kings who have passed down their slayer oath through generations.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_everpeak;Everpeak;;;;;;;;;x
ca_everpeak_desc;Everpeak, Karaz-a-Karak in the language of the Dwarfs, is the ancient capital of the Dwarf empire, the "Pinnacle of Mountains", the "Most Enduring". It is the oldest and most glorious hold of the mountain folk and inside its halls is the greatest concentration of wealth in the world. Visitors have been awestruck at the magnificent beauty of the place. The most important hold politically and religiously in Dwarf culture, Karaz-a-Karak boasts of the mightiest army, greatest runesmiths and largest population out of all the Dwarf realms. It is from here that the High Kings rule and where the sacred "Great Book of Grudges" and the "Book of Remembering" are kept. It has endured countless ages against all manner of foes but it has never fallen and will endure until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_zhufbar;Zhufbar;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
ca_zhufbar_desc;Zhufbar, known as the "Torrent-gate" in Khazalid, is a Dwarf hold built nestled in a deep chasm under the lake called Black Water. A huge waterfall that falls high above the city provides the necessary power for the numerous Dwarf machines that have been constructed here. The city is the principle shrine for the Engineers Guild and is a center of every kind of industry. It was here that the famed Gromril metal, which was mined from nearby Karak Varn, was smelted and forged into many famous Dwarf artefacts.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_barak_varr;Barak Varr;;;;;;;;;x
ca_barak_varr_desc;Barak Varr, Khazalid for "Sea Gate", is a unique Dwarf hold in that it is the only Dwarf seaport in the world and houses the whole Dwarf fleet. Located at the easternmost point of the Black Gulf, the hold is built in a vast water filled cavern, carved into a cliffside which provides a natural defence for the harbour. The mighty Ironclad ships of the Dwarfs as well as numerous merchant vessels from all over the world can be found here as well, sailing in and out of the vast cavern. This hold is among the most friendly to non-Dwarfs and in turn has great revenue from trade.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_iron_peak;Iron Peak;;;;;;;;;x
ca_iron_peak_desc;Known as "Iron Peak", Karak Azul is built with it's upper portion on a plateau overlooking the valley below, which is unusual compared to other holds. It is also the only southern Dwarf hold that has withstood the greenskin invasions over the centuries but at great cost since today Karak Azul's population is very meagre. However, many famous rune armours and weapons were and still are being made in the hold which has contributed to the continued survival of the hold.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_horn_hold;Horn Hold;;;;;;;;;x
ca_horn_hold_desc;Karak Hirn, or "Horn Hold" in Khazalid, is the largest and wealthiest of the Black Mountain holds. Its name comes from the fact when wind blows in a certain direction, the large cavern within the hold creates a sound reminiscent of a mighty warhorn which is heard for miles around and which the Dwarfs have taken advantage of for many uses.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_copper_mountain;Copper Mountain;;;;;;;;;x
ca_copper_mountain_desc;Translated as "Copper Mountain" in Khazalid, Karak Izor has the prestige of being the first and largest Dwarf hold outside the World's Edge Mountains. Located in the Vaults, it has access to the richest metal deposits, ranging from iron to copper and tin, outside the World's Edge Mountains and its influence is such that Dwarf settlements from all across the Vaults, and as far as the Apuccini Mountains, look to Karak Izor for protection and guidance. There is also a miniature version of the Underway being built deep beneath the Vaults which would allow unhindered trade between Dwarf settlements in the region.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_karak_norn;Karak Norn;;;;;;;;;x
ca_karak_norn_desc;Known as "Barren Earth Hold" in Khazalid, Karak Norn is the major hold in the Grey Mountains. Its population consists mainly of displaced clans from fallen holds across the Old World. While not being particularly wealthy because of the Grey Mountains' lack of large mineral deposits, Karak Norn does control the vital mountain passes in the southern Grey Mountains. It is also strategically placed on a high plateau above Loren Forest, to keep a close eye on the Wood Elves because of the long distrust the two races have for each other. Karak Norn is also on good terms with its neighbouring human realms and has helped both the Bretonnians and the Empire in the past.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kraka_drak;Kraka Drak;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kraka_drak_desc;Khazalid for Dragon Hold, the Norse Dwarfs of Kraka Drak have done much to earn their fearsome moniker. Said to be even more warlike than their cousins to the south, their entire society revolves around the virtue of war and the honor of battle, a necessary development given their location. This warlike demeanor has ensured their survival, however it has not been without a cost. Owing to their geographical remoteness, the foreignness of their customs, and the heterodox veneration of the ancestor gods as a collection of warrior aspects, they have become an isolated and culturally alien group to the rest of Dwarf-kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_mine_6;Gromnil Mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_mine_6_desc;Deep in the depths of the earth, Gromnil can be found. Easy to forge, yet nigh unbreakable once crafted, it is the most rare and valuable metal in the world. The lust for Gromnil has been the undoing of many dwarf realms as they dug too deep and disturbed the many foul creatures that lurk below in the lightless caverns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dwarfhold_1;Dwarf Hold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_dwarfhold_1_desc;Dwarf holds are typically near-impregnable, being fortified both above ground and underground and crafted by the most skilled stone masons of the known world. During sieges they are typically supplied from the vast underground network of deep roads which run below the surface, making it even harder to take one of these holds unless it is by a truly overwhelming direct assault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Specialising in the fine art of brewing ales and beers, the brewers guild and it's members have the utmost respect from the other Dwarfs, and establishing a guild here would help attract younger Dwarfs looking for a home, and help keep our people well stocked on beers and ales!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The elves of this region are even more bloodthirsty and unkind to strangers than their kin, often cutting the attacking forces down to the last snotling.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_cavaroc_desc;The Elves living in Skymark Reaches in the realm of Cavaroc are famed horsemasters, swift to attack and swift to anger, they will always be at the forefront of Athel Loren's armies when the forest is roused to war. The finest horses in the whole of Athel Loren are raised here thanks to the fact that this realm is one of the few which is sparsely-wooded, covered in rolling grass plains instead.;;;;;;;;;x

tb_atylwyth_desc;The realm of Atylwyth has been locked in the cold embrace of winter for an eternity, each tree coated in a thick glazing of frost and every glade heavy with deep snow. Only a rare few forest spirits dwell in this icy part of the forest and these few that remain slumber through the ages. As a result of this disconnection from the forest, the elves of Atylwyth are highly militant, boasting one of the largest and most well trained force of Eternal Guard in the whole of Athel Loren for they are the only force willing to protect this part of the great forest.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_yn_edryl_koiran;The Kings Glade;;;;;;;;;x
tb_yn_edryl_koiran_desc;Yn Edryl Koiran, otherwise known as the King's Glade, is an immense and awe-inspiring clearing at the heart of Athel Loren in the realm of Talsyn. Ever since the Elves first entered Athel Loren this glade has been the centre of their civilisation, holding council here even before Ariel and Orion arrived. Over the centuries Spellweavers have crafted a great city in the ancient oaks that surround the glade, buildings and chambers made out of the living trees everywhere from their roots to the tree branches. To the unawary visitor, the city is invisible thanks to most of the inhabitants living either beneath the ground or above their heads as well as the centuries of magic woven into the area. The King's Glade is also where Ariel and Orion rule with the aid of their council made up of fifteen lord and ladies from the forest realm, an extraordinarily prestigious post for any Asrai to hold.;;;;;;;;;x

Untold numbers of slaves have been brought here over the centuries, and the mines have developed into an extensive network.  A huge garrison of Chaos Dwarfs keeps vigilance over the tower and the surrounding area with rocket batteries aligned along the ramparts and towers of the citadel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Along with the Tower of Gorgoth, it vies for prominence and power as the second most important fortress-citadel of the Chaos Dwarfs beyond their heartland on the Zharrduk Plain. Unlike the Tower of Gorgoth, the purpose of the Black Fortress is as a purely military outpost, and is headquarters for the Legion of Azgorh. The legion is a mighty standing army which watches over the desolated southern Dark Lands, escorts the far-flung slave caravans through the Howling Wastes and stands as a bulwark against frequent invasions of Ogres, Orcs and worse from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

To create these powerful contraptions, they usually bind daemons to them and infuse their creations with the energies of Chaos. For the Chaos Dwarfs, magic and daemons are just another tool or resource, no different from iron and coal.

ca_kislev_desc;The large and well developed city of Kislev is home to the Tzars of Kislev who rule over their empire from the Palace Gospodarin located in the heart of this grand city. As with the entire Empire of Kislev, the city remains under constant threat from Norscans and Chaos forces lurking to the north. Despite this constant menace, the city of Kislev has never fallen to an invading army yet, standing strong against countless sieges while the surrounding countryside burns. The Ungol and Gospodarian people who live here are a hardy folk, their horsemanship and combat skills forever tempered by raids coming down from the north which has enabled the Tzars to field one of the most fearsome mounted armies in the Old World.;;;;;;;;;x

ca_praag_desc;The fortress city of Praag is one of the few permanent settlements of the Ungol people, serving as their de facto capital, and the northernmost bastion of civilization in the Old World. Due to the city's unfavorable position, Praag has been forced to endure near constant raids by the Chaos-worshipping Kurgans and the savage Norscans for centuries. Though the majority of these raids are a minor inconvenience dispersed by raising a pulk of horsemen from the barracks, several networks of walls have been constructed concentrically around the city kreml with far more serious threats in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Much of the city's wealth and status are a result of the lucrative trade in gems and silver with the more civilized peoples of Norsca, many of the goods eventually flowing from Erengrad to the Empire, or even further afield. Despite this enormous inflow of wealth, the city spends any spare coin constantly updating their defenses to the most modern standards, largely preventing Erengrad's burghers from spending on the frivolities that define Marienburg and the Tilea's trade cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_skeggi;Skeggi;;;;;;;;;x
ca_skeggi_desc;Skeggi is a Norscan colony in the New World near Hexoatl. It isn't very rich or prosperous, and the constant threat of Lizardmen and jungle horrors loom over the castle, but this has proven to be an advantage. All sorts of adventurers, explorers, treasure hunters, and mad-men alike come and make port at Skeggi, bolstering its numbers and providing a source of manpower to keep the jungle and its inhabitiants at bay.;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cavadaco;El Cadavo;;;;;;;;;x
ct_cavadaco_desc;The Grand Colony of El Cadavo, is Estalia's gem in the New World, bordered by Skeggi to the north, pirates to the south, and of course the Lizardmen everywhere else. Due to the constant threat, protection is a major concern for the city, and as such they have spared no expense in employing the famed Tercio formations of Estalia to the New World. But the city is not all war, as it also sits in a strategic trade position, sending goods across the ocean home to Estalia.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vampire_cove;Vampire's Cove;;;;;;;;;x
ca_vampire_cove_desc;Vampire's Cove, built upon the old ruins of Huatl, is a hub for pirate activity in central Lustria. Huatl was but a ruin of the Lizardmen, but once Luther Harkon and his undead pirate crew arrived, they conquered the stretch of Lustrian coastline now known as the Vampire coast. It is now as rich or powerful as any other coastal settlement, in no small thanks to being ruled by an immortal vampire.;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_aliman;Al-Aliman;;;;;;;;;x
ca_al_aliman_desc;Al-Aliman is an Arabyan Colony founded by Atruhayid corsairs, fierce mariners who still follow the old ways of Araby. Another recent colony with more spirit and ambition than solid power or wealth, it serves as a central hub of Old Worlder activity in southern Lustria. With spices and other exotic wares flowing through, and more and more adventurers and misfits arriving in search of adventure, the future of Al-Aliman seems promising and more importantly, profitable. It also fields famed Arabyan stallions, some of the finest horses in Lustria, not that there are many others to compete against!;;;;;;;;;x
tb_quittax;Qu'ittax;;;;;;;;;x
tb_quittax_desc;Qu'ittax is the largest Miyan-inhabited ruin in Lustria, and used to be an important city-temple of the Lizardmen. A great pit full of teeth and jagged rocks lies at it's center, where the Miyan perform bloody rituals to honour their ravenous god, Kukaili.;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ganaina;Ganaina;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ganaina_desc;Ganaina is the largest Amazon stronghold in Lustria, and the most important religious center as well. The core of this settlement is a collection of ancient pyramids and towers built by the Old Ones. This complex extends deep into the earth, creating a labyrinth of linked underground vaults full of the wonders left by their creators. The two largest pyramids looming over the settlement are the Queen's Palace and the Temple of Rigg. The Temple of Rigg is the heart of the Amazon faith, and the center of their teaching and instruction.;;;;;;;;;x

Blowdarts are simple tools, but these barbaric halflings have been able to perfect its uses into an art-form, with weekly competitions, with the winner usually getting to eat a prisoner after all is said and done. They wear mostly padded armor, but also wear striking masks to frighten their enemies and bring them luck on the battlefield. Their darts are tipped with poison from the most poisonous plants and frogs in the area, and it is considered a great honor to not only catch the frogs and tip darts in their poison, but also eat them...;;;;;;;;;x

Many generations of fierce Skink Priests strenously defended its ruined borders from the younger species during the course of the ages, successfully repelling hordes of Beastmen, Greenskins, Undead and Humans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_sudenburg;Sudenburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ca_sudenburg_desc;Sudenburg is one of the richest merchant cities of the Southlands and the only colony of Old Worlders that survived the backlash of the Bretonnian Crusades. Once a cosmopolitan meeting point of the different Arabyan, Southlander and Westerlander cultures, it has turned into a full Sigmarite city after the machinations of the Mahtmasi nearly caused its destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tp_witchhunter_samur;Witch Hunter Chapter;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tp_witchhunter_samur_desc;The Graf of Sudenburg granted the temple of Samur to the Knight-Captain who saved his city from the Mahtmasi's spells and prevented a war against the city-states of Olohrad and Al-Anaim in the XIX century. Since then, the Witch Hunters have been a constant presence in Sudenburg, keeping in check the influence of the undead lurking in the swamps around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

tp_barak_mazur_desc;The great Ziggurat-factory of Mazur, unbeknownst to most, has been for centuries one of the few wards against the Jade Vampires exterting their influence across the Old World. The Dawi Zharr of Mazur work their slaves to death to produce more warmachines and fortifications to defend their holdings in the Dragon Isles against the insidious threat of the Cathayan vampires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tb_mabuya_desc;When the Jade first arrived on the Dragon Isles, they used their gaze to brainwash almost all of the local Lizardmen, turning them into obedient slaves. Yet, the Old Ones provided for their children and one of their Spawning Pools gave birth to a wise and powerful Skink Priest who resisted the Jade and freed some of their siblings. Mabuya is the last independent outpost of the Lost Lizardmen, desperately trying to survive the vampiric invasion from the east.;;;;;;;;;x

tr_whaling_village_1_desc;Norscan Whalers are not just typical hunters, they are also well-abled warriors. Since whaling is an important trade for Norsca, Whalers are respected even among the warriors due to the extreme dangers of the waters surronding Norsca. Swimming through the dark currents of the Sea of Claws are massive whales, many of which bear strange markings, and odd colouration, twisted and warped as they are by the power of Chaos. These monsters can capsize ships and swallow hundreds of men in a single gulp. Thus, Whalers must be made of sterner stuff than ordinary fishermen;;;;;;;;;x
