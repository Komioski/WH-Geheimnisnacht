# CHAOS EVENTS
#
EVTDESCCHAOS.0;The Everchosen is the champion of all the Chaos gods. You can journey to the Altar of Ultimate Darkness in distant Naggaroth to seek the favour of the Chaos Gods. The stronger the Winds of Chaos are, the more likely they are to give you their mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.1.a;I wonder how strong the Winds of Chaos are...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.1;You make your way across the wastes, into the northern limits of Naggaroth, where stories tell of the Altar of Ultimate Darkness. Finally, after many trials, you reach your destination...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.a;Yes, I will march alongside the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.b;No, I will never march with that fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.10;An Everchosen has been selected, and a great war is being prepared. Daemons of the Dark Gods march under their banner - surely you yourself should also march to war alongside this new champion?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.2;The Winds of Chaos are weak at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are unlikely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.3;The Winds of Chaos are only moderately strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are less likely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.4.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.4;The Winds of Chaos are  strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are likely to grant you their blessing. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.5.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.5;The Winds of Chaos are very strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are almost certain to grant you their blessing if you pass their trials. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.6.a;I will prove myself worthy - charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.6;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, testing your faith to its very core. Your mind is strong enough to persevere, and finally you come to the test... you must defeat the Champion of the Gods to receive their mark!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.7.a;Urrrghh! No... not ... like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.7;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, and attacked by daemons of all sorts! You cannot hold on, the Gods are displeased at your trespass, and soon you are surrounded fighting desperately for your life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.8;You have won the duel against the champion, and you finally kneel before the Altar of Ultimate Darkness, and receive the mark of the Dark Gods. 'Rise... Everchosen... and conquer in our name' a terrible unison of four voices growls in your head...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.9.a;Let all bow before the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.9;You return to your lands, bearing the mark of the Gods. Across the wastes, word spreads like wildfire: An Everchosen has been selected, and armies of daemons march by [From.GetHerHis] side! They would be fools not to join you now in the coming war...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESCschaos1;You could have sworn you had a holding here,but there's nothing left. As you wonder what could have happened,you see the fortress flying over your head with wings of stone and disappearing in the the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17;[From.GetFirstName] is dragged and bound at the centre of the summoning circle while you start chanting the spell. What daemon should you call forth from the Warp to inhabit [From.GetHerHis] body and devour [From.GetHerHis] soul?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos17;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos17;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos17;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but at the last moment you manage to break free of your boundaries and interrupt the ritual. In the backlash of magical fires, you sneak out of the room, fleeing from your captor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17005;That was close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17006;Just a few words before the ritual is complete, [From.GetFirstName] manages to get free of [From.GetHerHis] boundaries, interrupting the ritual. Even worse, the backlash of the broken spell creates enough of a distraction to allow the prisoner to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17006;Gahhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but after the spell has been completed, something seem to go wrong. You feel something crawling inside you, but your body cannot handle the stress and you explode all over the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18005;It would seem the recipient was not appropriate. The spell somehow fails and the prisoner explodes into a bloody pulp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18005;Just... fetch me some new clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts bloating and decaying as the Plaguebearer reshapes it in a flurry of rupturing boils and swarming vermin. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos22;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos22;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos22005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts bloating and decaying as the Plaguebearer reshapes it in a flurry of rupturing boils and swarming vermin. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos22005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos24;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos24;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos24005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos24005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos27;You've prepared the summoning circle and all the needed materials to temporarily open a portal to the Warp and summon a daemon into this world. Which creature should you call?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos27;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos27;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos27;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos27;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEschaos27;I call forth a K'daai of Hashut!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos28;Despite your best efforts, the circle was not strong enough to contain the eldritch energies of the Chaos Realm. The Warp breaks through and a host of cavorting daemons drags you with them to meet their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos28;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos29;The Flamer slowly takes form before you, a collection of mouths and gooey limbs spitting fire and steaming ichor. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos29;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos30;The Plaguebearer slowly takes form before you, a humanoid creature with rotten skin, skinny limbs and a bloated belly filled with worms and decayed entrails. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos30;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos31;The Daemonette slowly takes form before you, an alluring androgynous creature with pale, silken skin bounded by hard chitin. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos31;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos32;The Bloodletter slowly takes form before you, a screaming red-skinned monster eager for battle.  The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos32;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos33;There's a creature of one of my Master's enemies in this land. I cannot tolerate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos33;Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos34;We are many and our Master is one. It's time to drag the wizard to our home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos34;Yessss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos35;In your pride you thought the host of daemons in your service would be easy to control. But you were wrong: the creature of the Warp have banded against you and, easily overcoming your powers, they drag you screaming into the Realm of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos35;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos38;A ravenous Bloodletter of Khorne has come to you, offering you promises of future conquests and victories and standing ready to do your bidding. Or so it says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos38;A decayed Plaguebearer of Nurgle has come to you, offering its eternal love and plenty of gifts from its Dark Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos38;A luscious Daemonette of Slaanesh has come to you, offering you to lead you through uncharted heights of pleasure and joy. Or so she claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos38;A raving Flamer of Tzeentch has come to you, offering you the power of the endless fires of the Changer of Ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEschaos38;A searing K'daai of Hashut has come to you, offering you the might and riches of the Bullfather's forges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos38;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos38;I don't need you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEMON_HUNT;Daemon Hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos40;There is a nefarious presence plaguing this province. A daemonic being might be at work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos40;It won't hide for longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos42;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tracked down a daemon hiding in your lands. The Witch Hunter is certain of the existence of the creature and requires your support to trap and cleanse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos42;Yes, destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos42;We have other things to worry about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos43;You've received support from your liege and are ready to spring the trap on the daemon and cleanse the land from its evil influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos43;Let us proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos44;The creature of Chaos revealed itself to be stronger than the Witch Hunter's faith. [From.GetFirstName]'s remains were found scattered in the main square, alongside the entrails of the soldiers you provided [From.GetHerHim] with. There is no trace of the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos44;The gods protect us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos45;A nosy Witch Hunter has managed to find out about your familiar. The daemon revealed itself to be more cunning than [From.GetHerHim] and managed to kill [From.GetHerHim], but it was also put on the run, rescinding the contract which was binding it to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos45;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos46;The accursed mortals have managed to trap you. You fight for as long as you can, but the Witch Hunters are finally able to send you screaming back to the Chaos Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos46;Grreeaaaahhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos47;An accursed Witch Hunter, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has managed to trap and destroy your familiar. Luckly for now, the connection between the two of you remains hidden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos47;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos48;After the cleansing of the daemon, you've spent a lot of time trying to figure out who the wicked creature of darkness was serving and you've finally concluded it must have been [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos48;No one can escape the righteous wrath of Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos49;"The Witch Hunter [From.GetFirstName] has managed to rally some ridiculous sort of ""proof"" regarding you consorting with daemons and demands now your confession.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos49;*Appeal to liege*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos49;*Banish the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos49;*Imprison the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos50;[From.GetTitledFirstName] stands accused, by [FromFrom.GetFirstName], on charges of consorting with daemons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos50;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos50;This is just posturing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos50;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in the darkest dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos51005;Papa Nurgle has brought forth good tidings and plentiful bounties for all the good people in the world. Today its servant has decided to honour you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos51005;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos53;[From.GetFirstName] craves to see what your worth is or spill your blood for Khorne. Would you accept the daemon's challenge and fight with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos53;Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos53;You're beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos54;The fight goes on until the daemon is prone on the ground, leaking ichor from numerous wounds. You're tired, but you've learned something more about battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos54;This is your place, vermin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos55;You try your best, but nobody ends the fight as victor. Even worse, the Bloodletter manages to sink its claws deep in your flesh a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos55;Grrnnhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos56;Despite your efforts, the daemon swiftly overcomes your defences and tears your body apart, leaving you near-dead on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos56;Gllfgrrnnthh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos57;You push the daemon back time and again and such is your display of violence that you feel the gaze of Khorne bearing upon you, granting your body new strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos57;Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos58;Your Master seems a little lonely. Maybe the mortal would like to spend some quality time with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos58;HmmmHmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos59;[From.GetFirstName] awaits you inside your rooms. The daemonette lures you in your bed, whispering honeyed words and promising you to unravel secrets from beyond the veil, if only you'd let her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos59;Yes, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos59;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos60;The lips of the daemon feel cold at the first kiss, but they quickly gain an exotic and irresistible flavour. And at every new taste of her, you feel as if your mind is opening to new horizons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos60;More, more!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos60;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos61;The whispers within your mind are getting louder. There is no doubt something else has found home within your body and is now struggling to wrestle its control from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos61;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos63;Your blood boils to the point of burning your flesh from the inside out. The daemon inside you keeps on tearing at your soul, taking away whatever is left of your consciousness, until your body has been completely transfigured and there is nothing left of you inside it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos63;One malady after the other, the daemon has completely devastated your body, to the point you yourself can barely recognize it. In the unimaginable suffering you are submitted to by your flesh slowly rotting away and worms feeding off your entrails, you finally accept the daemon's welcoming embrace to oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos63;No mortal indulgence can satiate your cravings any more. The burning desire instilled by the daemon is too much to bear, and it finally breaks your mind entirely as the daemon starts feasting on your soul, one delicious piece at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos63;More and more mutations wreck your body, repurposing it to the daemon's whims. At every change, you lose another part of yourself, until there's finally nothing left but the unholy creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos63;BLOOD AND SKULLS!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos63;The Great Father watches over you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos63;Time for some *real* fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos63;Krlleeaaaach!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos64;A never-ending rage burns through your body. You cannot rest, you cannot sleep, even the slightest wrong sends you into a roaring rampage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos64;Blood! BLOOOD!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos65;You tighten your hold on the courtier's neck, your vision blurred by rage. You don't know who that is or what he did to you, you only know that you won't find peace until you've disembowelled him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos65;Die! Die! DIE!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66;People feel safe in passing their titles to their children. They grow lazy heirs. Worthless! The only right by blood is the one gained by spilling that of your enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66;Only the strongest rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has issued a declaration regarding all [From.GetHerHis] vassals: from this day forward, all of your lands will be inherited only by those who show themselves worthy of them by testing their mettle in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos67;You first started just to crave more from your favourite sex, but now your lust has grown insatiable. Men, women, children... Nothing can sate your appetites any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos67;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos68;You pin the courtier on the wall and start tearing apart their clothes with inhuman strength. Your vision is blurred and you've yet to realize if you caught a man or a woman, but that surprise will be part of the fun when you slam yourself on them and start having your way with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos68;No, no, don't keep quiet! I liked you screaming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos69;You crawl on the table, reaching for another plate further away from your reach. You've not stopped eating since morning, but the more the pain in your stomach grows, the more you feel compelled stuffing it more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos69;Glmmglrrghh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos70;You've nearly turned blind with the last barrel of wine and cannot stand on your feet any longer, but you still crawl to the next. You've lost your chalice, therefore you just hug the cask and start suckling from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos70;Glglglgllglh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71;Why do you have to be bothered entertaining all those ugly, old harpies? From now on, only young and beautiful men shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71;Why do you have to have only ugly, old men as your servant? From now on, only young and beautiful women shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71;Now we'll finally have someone interesting around here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only men will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only women will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos72;You sneeze once more a copious amount of snot dropping on your chest and dripping all over your clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos72;Bleah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos73;Scores of boils have appeared all over your body, another of the charming gifts bestowed upon you by the daemon inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos73;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos74;A terrible fever has struck you, weakening your body and giving you horrible visions of the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos74;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos75;You can barely sleep any longer. You can feel the presence of the daemon inside you, whispering, pulling your flesh from the inside, turning it into something monstrous. You can see every little detail of your body which is slowly changing, while being unable to do anything about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos75;No, no, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76;To each his own, and to everyone something. Your realm will be better off with the lands and title divided unevenly between all. It's certain to create a lot of interesting situations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76;Indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all lands to be split on death of their possessor between all of their heirs, with the main beneficiary being the one with the most support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77;Control is but an illusion, why pretend it to exist in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77;No more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all laws of the realm to be null and void. Only the rule of the strong and cunning will determine the loyalty of the servants towards the masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78;Everybody expect the firstborn to be the favourite, everybody grooms him to be the best. It is the turn of the youngest now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78;Truly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that enceforth all lands shall be inherited by the youngest sons and daughters of the realm and no longer the eldest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79005;Luckly you manage to ambush [From.GetFirstName] with the help of a few guards and start reciting the exorcism as they bind [From.GetHerHim]. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you see the daemon being torn from [From.GetHerHis] with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79005;Praised be [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80005;You can feel it now: the daemon leaving you was nothing but an illusion! The presence has resurfaced again, gnawing at your soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80005;Not again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80006;It would seem your spell did not in fact succeeded in freeing [From.GetTitledFirstName] from the evil presence hiding inside [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80006;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, but the daemon has sunk its teeth inside you and doesn't let the body go without dragging your soul away as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81005;While the exorcism started for the better, the daemon did not leave its host without consequences: the foul creature dragged away the soul of [From.GetTitledFirstName], leaving an empty and lifeless shell behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81005;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos82;The daemon struggles as the last shred of life leaves your body. The welcoming cold of death is a balm for your mind and you can only laugh at the now-desperate attempts of the ethereal creature to hold onto you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos82;No soul left to eat. Time to leave, pathetic creature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos83;You cannot rest, nightmares of lightning and blood tear your mind every time you try to sleep.\n'YOU DARE TO CLAIM BLOOD AND GLORY WITH COWARDLY MEANS?! HOW CAN YOU KEEP DISHONORING YOURSELF WITH MAGIC!?!.'\nIn every dream the great armoured hound looks down upon you from his throne, berating and belittling you.\n'I HAVE NO USE FOR WEAKLINGS AND DECEIVERS!';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos83;Continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos83;Then take away the stain of magic, Lord of Skulls, so that I may serve you better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos84;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has requested you to prepare a summoning circle, for [From.GetSheHe] desires for you to call a daemon from the Realms of Chaos and bind the creature into [From.GetHerHis] service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos84;Very well, I shall do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos84;No. It's not worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos85;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your request, pointing you out the dangers of opening a portal to the Realm of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos85;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos86;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted your requests. When the fateful night comes, [From.GetSheHe] prepares the summoning circle and all the needed ingredients and, with you at [From.GetHerHis] side, starts chanting the summoning spell that will bring a daemon into your world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos87;You are not sure of what is happening until too late: the ritual has failed. A host of terrifying daemons break through the summoning circle to drag you and the sorcerer into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos87;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos88;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a raving Flamer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos88;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos89;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a decomposing Plaguebearer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos89;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos90;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind an alluring Daemonette to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos90;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos91;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a brutal Bloodletter to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos91;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92;The Blood God watches over you from his throne of skulls. What is your offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos92;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92001;The Lord of Skulls is pleased with your offering. With a flash of fire and a burst of blood, a daemonic apparition floats down from the sky, allowing you to pick a boon of your choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92001;Some of your warriors, to crush my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92001;Fill me with your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92001;Fill me with your energy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92002;The Lord of Skulls must be pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature tears its way into reality to offer its services to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92002;You'll follow my orders from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92003;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with unholy rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92003;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92004;The ground cracks and a great river of blood bursts forth to cover you and your followers. Clearly the Lord of Skulls looks you favourably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92004;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92005;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92005;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92006;The smoke of your offering creates intricate designs, you can see the grand design of your patron, finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92006;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92008;Despite your effort, the Lord of Skulls has not reacted to your offering. Perhaps you've not given enough to satiate his thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92008;Grmmmh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93;Papa Nurgle is always ready to dispense his gifts to all who are in need. All the same, he's happy to receive offering from his own followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos93;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93001;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious fog and a jolly voice resonates in your ears, thanking you for your gift and asking to pick a boon of your choosing in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93001;I wish to receive magic, to better spread your gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93001;I wish my servants to love me as I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93001;I wish to share your gifts with all of my servants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93002;Papa Nurgle must be really pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature claws out of the ground, ready to hug and serve you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93002;I'm so happy to meet you, friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93003;As your offering burns, you feel the love of Nurgle filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93003;Why can't we just all get along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93004;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious green fog, undoubtedly proving the Lord of the Flies' unconditional love for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93004;I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93005;As your offering burns, you feel Nurgle's generosity filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93005;Let everyone share in his gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93006;The fumes of the pyre fill your lungs and you can see the marvellous future the Lord of Flies has in store for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93006;I'm coming Papa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93008;Papa Nurgle has certainly accepted your present, but it could be that others are in greater need of his gifts than you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93008;Don't worry, I'll wait for next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94;The Serpent always thirsts for more delights and greedily takes anything which is offered up. What will you offer Slaanesh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos94;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94001;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. Your offering has momentarily pleased your Master, to the point they'll grant you a gift of your choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94001;Grant me mastery over the Winds of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94001;Make me beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94001;Heal my body so that I may be whole again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94002;One of the bodies on the pyre stands up and shakes off the flames, shambling away from the others. As it moves, the flesh crawls and flickers and when it reaches you, you realize it is a daemon, a gift from the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94002;Let us know each other, yes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94003;Like a beacon, the pyre draws a black pegasus to the field. The wild creature descends upon you and bows at your feet, clearly a gift from the Serpent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94003;How about turning around now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94004;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. The Serpent's sweet words clearly show you must be amongst his favourites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94004;Never doubted it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94005;As the flames burn on the pyre, so too does a new lust inflame your soul, rekindled by the Dark Prince's touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94006;The bodies on the pyre create the most interesting shapes while they burn. You can see the artistry of your Master behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94006;Yes... yes it is so clear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94008;You've waited until the last embers have gone cold, but there has been no response from your Master. The Dark Prince must have a poor disposition today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94008;Rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95;The Changer of Ways is fickle in his rewards and greedy in his requests. What shall you give to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos95;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95001;Motes of unnatural light dance over the pyre and you can feel the Architect of Fate is looking at you, ready to grant your heart's desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95001;Magic! Grant me the true power of Chaos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95001;Knowledge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95001;More power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95002;One of the bodies on the pyre explodes in a shower of gore. The melted remains come together into an unnatural shrieking mix, a daemonic gift from your Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95002;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95003;As the smoke rises, you can feel the touch of Tzeentch upon you. The Changer of Ways has given you his greatest gift: magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95003;Power over reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95004;The shining smokes and twisting flames undoubtedly show the favour of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95004;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95005;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95005;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95006;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95006;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95008;The Great Plotter's plan is yet to be uncovered. Nothing happened after your offering was sent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95008;Next time... next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos96;The Gods blessed you on the fields of battle today. Your patron's eye is looking right inside your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos96;I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos97;Only the best survive the endless trials of the gods. You are more than all the others, you are a true champion of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos97;Glorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos98;There is no doubt your god has something special in mind for you. You have received many gifts and have ascended as a chosen servant of your deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos98;I shall be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos99;The time has come. You've endured hardship, you've survived all of your patron's generous gifts, you've outdone the efforts of others to please your deity, and he has finally rewarded you with the ultimate gift: you leave your old husk and in a storm of twisting bone and melding flesh you achieve apotheosis and are reborn as an immortal Daemon Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos99;Reaaaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos100;[From.GetFirstName] struggles desperately within your clutches, but it's too late for [From.GetHerHim]. You open your jaws and suck [From.GetHerHis] delicious soul from the pathetic husk, feasting upon [From.GetHerHis] essence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos100;Marvellous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos101;The terrible daemon who captured you has the worst in store for you: dragging you out of your cage with its claws, the creature reaps your soul out of the body and feasts upon it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos101;Hhhhhhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos102;The host of daemons emerges from the aether, ready to follow your lead and scourge the lands of the mortals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos102;March!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos104;Your daemonic forces disband, dragged back into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1;You're challenge has been issued and so it echoes across the plains: you will organize a great tournament to please Khorne and gain his favour. Any who believes himself worthy of the gaze of Skull God will gather and you will all fight and bleed and kill until only one remains to bask in the triumph of ultimate victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1900;It's been a long journey, but you're finally back home. A great challenge for Khorne can only be organized every so often, it'll be decades before another one may be issued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1900;I'll just kill in some other way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1001;I challenge you, scum!\n I call upon you to shed blood in name of Khorne! Meet me and any others who will heed this call at the plains and face my wrath! Only the strongest will survive to bask in the glory of Lord of Skulls!!\n\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1001;I'll rip your heart OUT!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaosfl1001;You're not worthy of my blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1002;You miserable worm!\n Ready yourself to depart from this world! Before the next moon the Bloodletters will feast upon your wretched soul as I claim my rightful place at Khorne's side!\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1002;Ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1003;The boasts of the weak do not concern me,\n shriek and batter your chest won't make you a worthy adversary to fell with my blade.\n\n  [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1003;Coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl2;Several warriors have answered to your call, gathering in the barren plain chosen for the deadly tournament in honor of the Lord of Skulls. Not all are challengers, the word of the great bloodbath caught the attention of many aspiring champions, wanderers, curious and traders.\n Once you and the other challengers are reunited, all of the other followers surround you, looking towards you in anticipation.\n Above them, the tattered tabards with Khorne's rune blow in a hot wind, their poles already surrounded by little offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaosfl2;Not enough warriors came at your call. The plain lies empty before you, with just some curious cultists roaming around, squabbling over minor quarrels. You've waited for a few days now and it is certain no one else will come.\n It is with great regret that you announce you are forced to cancel the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2;BlOOD! BLOOD AND SKULLS!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaosfl2;This was a waste of time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2001;Several warriors have answered [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s call, gathering in the barren plain chosen for the deadly tournament in honor of the Lord of Skulls. Not all are challengers, the word of the great bloodbath caught the attention of many aspiring champions, wanderers, curious and traders.\n Once you and the other challengers are reunited, all of the other followers surround you, looking towards you in anticipation.\n Above them, the tattered tabards with Khorne's rune blow in a hot wind, their poles already surrounded by little offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2001;BlOOD! BLOOD AND SKULLS!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2002;As the first challenger it is only right that you have the honor of starting the deathmatch. Khorne only favours the ruthless and the strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2002;Glory to Khorne! Face me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2003;It is your turn to fight for the glory of Khorne and yourself. You walk towards the centre of the plain, accompanied by the cheering of the cultists sitting and standing in the field around you. [From.GetFirstName], your adversary, comes from the opposite side to meet you in the middle. You roar and clash your weapons on your armors, before charging each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2003;DIE!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2004;It is your turn to fight for the glory of Khorne and yourself. You walk towards the centre of the plain, accompanied by the cheering of the cultists sitting and standing in the field around you. [From.GetFirstName], your adversary, comes from the opposite side to meet you in the middle. You roar and clash your weapons on your armors, before charging each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2004;DIE!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2005;[From.GetFirstName] was furious to announce that, due to lack of challengers, the tournament will be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2005;All this road for nothing!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl3001;You charge [From.GetFirstName], smashing [From.GetHerHis] armor in with a powerful blow and preparing to cut off [From.GetHerHis] head with your blade as [From.GetSheHe] laid on the ground, but [From.GetFirstName] manages to dodge your attack, rolling on the side and tripping you with a kick. Your opponent gets back on [From.GetHerHis] feet, charging in, waving [From.GetHerHis] weapon towards you, but you manage to take advantage of [From.GetHerHis] recklessness and plunge your blade through [From.GetHerHis] neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaosfl3001;[From.GetFirstName] draws the first blood, cutting a long red line on your arm with [From.GetHerHis] blade and pushing you away with [From.GetHerHis] shield before you could counterattack. Your opponent licks off the blood from [From.GetHerHis] weapon and charges again. You clash your blades several times, taunting and grunting, but, when you finally start to tire your arm, you manage to get an opening and cut through [From.GetHerHis] chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaosfl3001;You ram into [From.GetFirstName], rising [From.GetHerHim] over your head and tossing [From.GetHerHim] away, then you run to recover your weapon while [From.GetSheHe] tries to get back on [From.GetHerHis] feet. \n Your opponent growls something, bashing [From.GetHerHis] blade on [From.GetHerHis] shield. When you reach [From.GetHerHim] [From.GetSheHe] swings the blade to chop your head off, but you're fast enough to drop on your knees and slice [From.GetHerHim] from belly to neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaosfl3001;You charge [FromFrom.GetFirstName], smashing [FromFrom.GetHerHis] armor in with a powerful blow and preparing to cut off [FromFrom.GetHerHis] head with your blade as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] laid on the ground, but [FromFrom.GetFirstName] manages to dodge your attack, rolling on the side and tripping you with a kick.

norscan_government;Norscan Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
norscan_government_desc;Norsca is inhabited by a race of savage and ferocious Men; fur-clad warriors and berserkers of hairy brawn who sail the seas in fearsome longships in order to unleash their devastating fury upon the south. Warlike and cruel, the Norse are the very epitome of the Warriors of Chaos; fanatically devoted champions of the Dark Gods and the baneful scourge of their foes. Norsca is a savage and brutal land, plagued by lethal winters for more than half the year, and worse, lashed perpetually by raging gales of Chaos energies howling down from the ancient ruins of the fallen Warp Gate resting at the very heart of the northern Chaos Wastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

chaos_host_government_desc;Out of all the many threats that the Old World must face, none strikes such fear and misery into the hearts of Men like the Followers of Chaos. Slaves to darkness all, they have given themselves wholly to the Ruinous Powers, some willingly, others because they felt they had no other choice. Chaos itself is a corrupting influence upon the world, like a dark, malign cancer that eats at the minds of all those that live within the World. No single race, no matter how noble or powerful, will ever be safe from their barbaric invasions, nor are they safe from the seductive whispers of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
