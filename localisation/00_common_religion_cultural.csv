STAT_PIETY_MOJO;Mojo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MONTHLY_PIETY_MOJO;Monthly Mojo Increase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STAT_PIETY_DESC_MOJO;Mojo represent the level of protection and respect a Shadowman demands from the spirits of the dark forests, obtained by performing the correct rituals and collecting fetishes and amulets of protection. Like Prestige, it is added to your score on the death of a ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CLARITY;Clarity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STAT_PIETY_CLARITY;Clarity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MONTHLY_PIETY_CLARITY;Monthly Clarity Increase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STAT_PIETY_DESC_CLARITY;The road to enlightment is hard and narrow. Clarity is what every Cathayan seeks to achieve, through study and meditation and by interpreting and following the will of the Celestial Dragons. Like Prestige, it is added to your score on the death of a ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

STAT_PIETY_DESC_VIRTUE;Virtue is respected by the Bretonnian nobility and the Grail Damsels.

STAT_PIETY_HONOUR;Honour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
MONTHLY_PIETY_HONOUR;Monthly Honour Increase;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
STAT_PIETY_DESC_HONOUR;Honour is one of the main concepts in Dwarf culture and religion. Any Dwarf who properly maintains honour by settling Grudges and honouring the ancestors will be respected by his peers. Living without Honour is one of the worse fates a Dwarf can aspire to, for it means either living as an Oathbreaker or becoming a Slayer in order to seek honourable death in battle. Like Prestige, it is added to your score on the death of a ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# DESCRIPTIONS
#
norscan_gods_DESC;The Norscan Gods are as harsh and unforgiving as the land itself. In the superstitious beliefs of the Norscans, there are a vast multitude of Gods and spirits that must be appeased to ward off disaster, leading to an endless array of rites, sacrifices, charms and prayers. Many of these 'spirits' are Daemons or the Ruinous Power themselves, happily accepting the worship directed their way, though there are also plenty of benign subjects of worship. Some Gods from the south are also worshipped, such as Ursun, Ulric and Taal, but others are derided as soft and weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

northern_gods_DESC;The Northern Gods are loose collection of deities, minor spirits and other beings that were widely worshipped among the nomadic tribes of what would become known as Kislev and the Chaos Wastes. As the Realm of Chaos expanded and the Kurgan turned to worshipping crueller Gods, the Ungol and Gospodar tribe migrated south and settled in Kislev, bringing with them the worship of Ursun, Dazh and Tor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As the Realm of Chaos expanded and the Kurgan turned to worshipping crueller Gods, the Ungol and Gospodar tribe migrated south and settled in Kislev, bringing with them the worship of Ursun, Dazh and Tor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sigmarite_DESC;The Cult of Sigmar is one of the newer additions to the pantheons of the Old World, but is one of the most influential. After Emperor Sigmar's departure to the east, he was deified and became the patron and protector of the Empire. The Sigmarite faith has an ancient alliance with the Dwarfs, and is on reasonably good terms with most other Old World cults. The Grand Theogonist holds enormous power, and with the Arch-Lectors of Talabheim and Nuln holds three of the traditional Imperial Elector seats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kislev_gods_DESC;The Kislevites worship loose collection of deities, minor spirits and other beings that were widely worshipped among the nomadic tribes of what would become known as Kislev and the Chaos Wastes. As the Realm of Chaos expanded and the Kurgan turned to worshipping crueller Gods, the Ungol and Gospodar tribe migrated south and settled in Kislev, bringing with them the worship of Ursun, Dazh and Tor. The highest of Gods is Ursun, the Father of Bears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#kislev_gods_DESC;The Kislevites worship a variety of Gods, the highest of them is Ursun, the Father of Bears. Bears are specially sacred to the Kislevites, and they are forbidden to hunt them during winter. Ursun has no temples or stablished priesthood. Instead, he is worshipped in small natural groves in each city, or remote caves in the wild tundras of Kislev. A common offering to Ursun consists on placing a piece of meat or fish in front of the door of the supplicants house, in order to receive the help and favour of the Bear God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
myrmidian_DESC;Myrmidia is the Goddess of Warriors and Strategists, and patroness of the art and the sciences of war. Her cult is one of the largest and most widespread in the Old World, having formed thousands of years ago after the lands of Estalia and Tilea were united by the mortal avatar of Myrmidia. There remains two conflicting sects: One which holds that she appeared in Estalia and conquered Tilea, and one which holds the reverse. Despite that, statues and shrines dedicated to Myrmidia can be found all around Estalia and Tilea, and their inhabitants invoke Her name for aid in times of peace and war. The head of her cult is known as "La Última Águila" in Estalian, or "L'ultima Aquila" in Tilean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
grail_DESC;The Lady of the Lake is the national Goddess of Bretonnia and patroness of Chivalry. She demands nobility, honour, courage, and absolute steadfast approach to all things. All proper Bretonnian nobles must worship the Lady, and they regularly pray to Her asking protection in battle. Those outside the nobility are forbidden from praying to Her under penalty of death, instead, the peasants and burghers of Bretonnia follow other Gods widely found throughout the Old World. The Cult of the Lady and Her priestesses are outside, above and beyond the nobility, and have the authority to issue orders even to the King. The head of the cult is the Fay Enchantress, and her word is the word of the Goddess. She has the authority to depose and exile any Bretonnian noble, up to the King himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manannite_DESC;Manann is the God of the Oceans and Great Rivers. He is described as both angry and capricious, appeased by worshippers rather than praised or adored. Nevertheless, he inspires a fervent devotion in his followers. The Cult of Manann plays a vital role in the shipping and trade of the Old World, and many rulers who have held ambitions across the seas have found their ambition curtailed because they did not pay the proper respects to the Master of the Oceans. The cult is exceptionally powerful in Marienburg, where the highest clerics of the cult wield a great amount of political power there, as they dispense the blessings of Manann to the trading ships that come and go from the the ports.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_DESC;The forces of Chaos, often called the Ruinous Powers, the Primordial Annihilator or the Great Enemy, exist in a Daemonic realm beyond our own - ruled over by four powerful and terrifying Gods. Khorne, the Blood God, Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, Slaanesh, Prince of Pleasure and Nurgle, the Plague Lord. Many minor Chaos Gods may or may not exist - and the Four go by many names and are worshipped in many guises. Chaos is naturally divided against itself, and the four Gods war against each other incessantly, uniting only to plot the doom of the mortal world. Yet the four Gods of Chaos are often worshipped as one, be it as single being or as a pantheon of multiple Gods. Of all the followers of Chaos, those who tread the path of Chaos Undivided worship Chaos in it's purest form.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tzeentch_DESC;Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, is the Chaos God of change, plots, intrigue and sorcery. He is the most subtle of the Dark Gods, weaving schemes within schemes of a complexity beyond mortal comprehension. His followers are drawn to him in search of arcane knowledge and forbidden power. As the Changer of Ways, Tzeentch is obsessed with mutation and accelerated evolution and his followers are gifted with strange new bodies as a reward for their services - provided they survive the change. Tzeentch is fundamentally opposed to Nurgle due to his endless attempts to twist and create, rather than allow decay to run its course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nurgle_DESC;Nurgle is the Chaos God of disease, pestilence, decay and plague. Revolting in aspect, Nurgle is a darkly humorous God - taking a sick joy in inflicting his many afflictions upon the mortal world. His followers come to him initially to seek extended life or the power to resist sickness, but are soon corrupted in mind as well as body by his influence, taking the same perverse joy in spreading disease as their God does. Nurgle's miring decay and hopelessness makes them opposed to Tzeentch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
slaanesh_DESC;Slaanesh is the Prince of Pleasure, embodying pleasure, decadence, pride, perfectionism and creativity. Slaanesh's followers live only to glorify their dark master through ever-increasing displays of excess and vanity, taking part in feasts and orgies of legendary proportions, creating soul-achingly beautiful works of art, or pursuing some unreachable ideal in skill or aesthetics. This should not be taken for softness however, as Slaanesh enjoys blessing the faithful with impossible gifts of mind and body. Slaanesh's inward-focused pride and decadence makes them the unconditional enemy of Khorne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
khorne_DESC;Khorne the Blood God, Lord of Skulls is master of bloodshed, violence and mindless destruction and patron of warriors, murderers and psychopaths. Every life taken in anger pleases Khorne, and the greater the challenge involved the better. Khorne's champions become blood-soaked berserkers, festooned with skulls taken from their favourite conquests and trembling with barely-suppressed rage at the universe. Khorne's hatred of Slaanesh stems from his love of destroying all that is refined, leaving nothing for indulgence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cult_of_pleasure_DESC;The Cult of Pleasure is an ancient one, stemming from just after the High Elves first won their wars against Chaos. Centred around Morathi, it was destroyed in the wars of the breaking, but from time to time, especially during times of peace and ease, certain Elves of less than stellar character are drawn to recreate it. Its adherents care only for their own pleasures, living indolent lives of splendour and decadence. The Phoenix King is always wary of its return, fearing another bloody civil war, so agents of the crown do all they can to stop it from spreading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
noreligion_DESC;This is not a strange form of atheism (see Necoho) but a missing religion entry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancestor_gods_DESC;Veneration of Ancestors is the centrepiece of Dwarf religion and and important part of their culture. Most of their "deities" are actually the venerated ancestors of the Dwarf race. The main triad, worshipped by most Dwarfs, are Grungni, Ancestor God of Mining and Stoneworking, Valaya, Ancestor goddess of the Home and Healing and Grimnir, Ancestor God of Warriors. Many other myriads of ancestors are worshipped by each individual clan and craftguild, usually their founder or someone of great importance to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_ancestor_gods_DESC;This is an unique form of the Dwarf religion of ancestor worship, that evolved independently from the main holds. The Norse variant still worships the ancestors of the Dwarf race, but in an animistic fashion, with aspects and spirits of the harsh Norscan lands that surround them becoming their "ancestors" as well. Grimnir, the Ancestor God of War is held in the highest regard by the Norse Dwarfs, and some warriors, known as "Berserkers", similar to the Slayers of their southern cousins, try to channel Grimnir's might in battle by drinking a mix of strong beer and strange mushrooms to enter in a powerful frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_faith_DESC;The Old Faith is a collection of animistic practices dating back to the earliest of known Humans. It revolves around worshipping the natural forces themselves, and a concept known as the "Mother", which symbolizes the earth and the fertility of nature itself, rather than a deity in the conventional sense. Though overshadowed by the organized cults of newer Gods, the Old Faith still survives in remote and rural areas of the Old World, mostly untouched by the hand of Man. Its priests are known as Druids, and usually meet in secluded groves or circles of standing stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Though overshadowed by the organized cults of newer Gods, the Old Faith still survives in remote and rural areas of the Old World, mostly untouched by the hand of Man. Its priests are known as Druids, and usually meet in secluded groves or circles of standing stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_ones_DESC;The "Old Ones" are an ancient race of beings who came from the stars, with a power so great that it could shape worlds to their whims. The Lizardmen, one of their many creations, now venerate the Old Ones as their gods and long-gone masters, and try to carry out and interpret their "Great Plan". The Slann Mage Priests are at the head of the most important rituals and sacrifices, while Skink Shamans usually conduct the lesser divinations. Some of the well-known Old Ones include Sobek, the vengeful Serpent God, Chotec, the benevolent Sun God and Quetzl the great protector and God of Warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hashut_DESC;Hashut is the Dark Father of Chaos Dwarfs, a cruel and violent deity, His idols usually depict him as a brazen bull. To this day, scholars still discuss whether Hashut is a true Chaos God, an upstart Great Daemon or something else, a primordial force that was spawned in the dawn of time. During the Great Cataclysm, the Ancestor Gods abandoned those that would become the Chaos Dwarfs, who found salvation in a new master, Hashut. In reward for centuries of devotion, He has gifted the Chaos Dwarfs with dark, sorcerous secrets. Sacrifices to Hashut are usually thrown into great, bull-shaped furnaces, where they burn to the death in His honour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nehekharan_gods_DESC;There are many Gods and Goddesses in the Nehekharan pantheon, taking hundreds of different forms. These include natural phenomena (stars, moon, sun etc.) or animals of the desert. Some of the most important Gods are: Ptra the God of the Sun, Asaph the Goddess of Magic and Usirian, God of the Underworld. Most of their gods are only remembered because of their blessings on the Nehekharan armies, as all gods relating to average life have been nullified since "proper life" was destroyed by the curse of Nagash. Despite everything, the gods of old Nehekhara have continued to guide and aid their charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
greenskin_gods_DESC;The Greenskins are a superstitious bunch, and so, they worship a myriad of minor Gods and fetishes, but far above these lesser spirits and trinkets stand Gork and Mork, the true kings of the Greenskin pantheon. They are not worshipped in the weak fashion of the other races, instead all Greenskins look up to the deeds of the twin gods for inspiration. In these tales, Gork is brutally cunning and Mork is cunningly brutal, though the Greenskins tend to fight over which one is what, as they do with everything else. Shamans are in direct ( And some times, violent ) contact with Gork & Mork, and are even able to summon them in battle in order to crush their enemies or support the other Greenskins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spider_god_DESC;The Forest Goblins worship the giant Arachnarok spiders as avatars of the Spider God. Due to the havoc the giant spiders caused to the Forest Goblin tribes, they tried to placate the fury of the spiders adding strange eight-legged idols next to the traditional effigies of Gork and Mork. Their shamans started eating an smaller variant of this poisonous spider in order to enter a trance state, which eventually led to communication with the Aracnarock spiders, who were somehow convinced to leave the Goblins alone. Now their nests are sacred places for the Forest Goblins, home to the great Spider God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stromfels_DESC;Stromfels is the cruel and capricious God of Storms and Sea Monsters, as well as the patron of pirates. He is usually depicted as a giant shark. Stromfels is often seen as the nemesis of Mannaan, God of the Oceans, though many whisper that they are one and the same, Stromfels merely being a darker aspect of Mannaan. His cult is banned all across the Old World, and specially in the Empire, due to it's criminal and heretical nature. Followers of Stromfels worship their God by feeding sacrifices to sea monsters and causing shipwrecks. The most prized sacrifice to their God is throwing a priest of Mannaan into the jaws of a great shark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon_DESC;Though many Amazonian legends also refer to the mythical "Old Ones", worshipped by the Lizardmen as their long-lost creators, the Amazons worship other jungle deities and spirits. The most important to them is Rigg the Great Huntress. Goddess of War and Victory, she's the legendary founder of Amazonia, and is usually depicted as a tall, strong woman with fiery red hair and eyes. Serena the Snake-Goddess of Fertility, Sorcery and Trickery is greatly honored in spring, where Amazons conduct fertility rituals to ensure the continuance of their tribes. Some Miyan tribes also pay some homage to the Amazon deities (Out of fear, if anything else), but most worship Kukaili, the Great Devourer, a savage and bloody deity of grand appetite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atharti_DESC;Atharti is the Cytharai Goddess of seduction, pleasure and indulgence, often followed by the Sorceress Covens of Morathi in Ghrond. She is represented as a beautiful, masked elf woman, with red serpents tangled around her body. She has a great rivalry with her sister Hekarti, Goddess of Dark Magic, and both have tried to kill each other in multiple occasions. Dark whispers often accuse Atharti followers of being just one misstep away from outright worshipping Slaanesh.;;;;;;;;;;x
ulrican_DESC;Ulric is the God of wolves, battle and winter. He's usually represented dressed as an ancient warrior, wearing a silver-grey wolf pelt cloak. Before the rise of Sigmar, Ulric was the patron God of the Teutogens, one of the Human tribes that would form the Empire. Despite the rise of other cults, Ulric is still very popular in Middenland, and is considered the patron God of the city of Middenheim. His priesthood still holds a strong influence in the Empire, and their head the Ar-Ulric, is an Elector of the Empire, a right descended from the former duty of the Ar-Ulric to crown the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
taalite_DESC;The cult of Taal and Rhya is amongst the most ancient religions in the Old World. Taal is considered the King of Gods, and as such he governs all Nature. He is married to Rhya, the compassionate Goddess of the Land, Love and Fertility. They are usually worshipped in a couple, but woodsmen and foresters worship tend to favour Taal, whereas Farmers, Fishermen and Lovers favour Rhya. The cult of Taal and Rhya is popular all across the Old World, but specially so in Talabecland, with Talabheim being a sacred city to to them. The priesthood of Taal and Rhya is not as influential in Imperial politics as Sigmar's or Ulric's. Its leadership rotates between two Hierarchs, one for Spring and Autumm and other for Summer and Winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cytharai_DESC;The Cytharai are the Elven Gods of the Mirai, the Underworld, they are headed by Ereth Khial, the Pale Queen. While in Ulthuan and Athel Loren they are only to be appeased in small ceremonies, the Dark Elves of Naggaroth openly worship these deities. The most widely spread religion amongst them is the worship of Khaine, a God of many aspects, but especially, War and Murder. Many small cults and covens worship him, but none are better known than the Witch Elves, which constantly sacrifice prisoners to curry favour with their Bloody God. Other popular gods include, Hekarti, Mistress of Magic, Atharti, Lady of Desire and Anath Raema, the Savage Huntress. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cadai_DESC;The Cadai are the Elven Gods of the Heavens, headed by Asuryan, the Creator. The cult of Asuryan is the most popular with the Elves of Ulthuan, as he is worshipped by all independently of their profession and class. All Asur must make a pilgrimage to the main temple of Asuryan in the Isle of Flame in Ulthuan at least once. The Isle of Flame is where the Phoenix King is crowned and made to pass the test of the flames of Asuryan. Besides Asuryan, the High Elves also worship the other gods of their pantheon depending on their professions. For example, mages tend to favour Hoeth, the Lord of Wisdom and Knowledge, while smiths worship Vaul, the Maker. The Dark Elves entirely ignore the Cadai pantheon, while the Wood Elves favour Kurnous, the Hunter, over Asuryan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
halfling_gods_DESC;Halfling religion is mostly centred around Esmeralda, Goddess of the Hearth and Home, and Her children. Esmeralda is said to have given the Halflings the gift of cooking, and as such most of their rituals and prayers are centred around what Halflings love most, food. There aren't temples to talk about, most worship of the Halfling pantheon is done at their homes, and placing small clay effigies of Esmeralda in the kitchen, so that She watches over it, is enough for the believers to ensure that their food doesn't spoil. The cult of Esmeralda is mostly confined to The Moot, but individual Halflings all across the world worship Her as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
akghan_DESC;Akghan means "Sorcery" in the dialects of the Human tribes settled in the the Southlands. It's a blend of native Southlander customs and cults imported from foreign lands, like the Ormazd's or Sigmar's, though these deities fall into the category of spirits, known in their native tongues as the "loa". The Witch-Doctors, soothsayers and priests of the Akghan, are charged with communicating with the benevolent ones and warding villages against the darker spirits, said to be soulless creatures made out of shadows and flying vermin. For this purpose, they use all sorts of magic rituals, enchanted fetishes and trinkets, a practice known as "voodoo". Though the Witch-Doctors are very independent in their actions, when in need of counsel, they defer the wisest of their own, the Big Houngan, who resides in Olohrad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazd_DESC;Ormazd is the sole Arabyan God. He is also known as Al-Alnon, "The One". His symbol is the Flame of Truth. Ormazd used to be a relatively minor god from the small caravan town of Martek. His cult rose to supremacy thanks to the efforts of mountain sages, known as the "prophets", who spread the religion through Araby. The greatest of these is Mulhaed al-Quyat, the Sword of Ormazd, credited for first spreading the teachings of Ormazd across all Araby. All faithful are required to make a pilgrimage at least once to the holy city of Martek. Though it has no formal priesthood, the Scholars, wisemen and powerful mages, ensure the furtherance of the Way of the One, and are granted powerful holy magic by Ormazd, so that they may burn even the foulest of the undead. The Calif, usually of the blood of al-Quyat, is considered the spiritual head of the cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atruhayid_DESC;Some of the corsairs and desert nomads in Araby still cling to the worship of the ancient gods (known as "marids") that came before the rise of Ormazd, collectively, they are known as the Atruhayid, the "Idolaters". They worship these deities in the form of numerous idols of all shapes and colours. One of the gods most favored by the corsairs of Araby is Bezin-Anan, Marid of the Seas, it is said that, despite the efforts of the Prophets of Ormazd, the cult to Bezin-Anan persists in the great city of Lashiek. The nomad tribes pay utmost respect to Bez-Ghodan, Marid of the Deserts. He's the eldest of the Marid, and on His will, rivers run and dry, and sandstorms wake and wane. Idols dedicated to foreign gods, like Stromfels or Khaine under different names, are not uncommon as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Idols dedicated to foreign gods, like Stromfels or Khaine under different names, are not uncommon as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kitabid_DESC;The Kitabids - the "Followers of the Book" - are an Ormazdic sect that rejects the notion of a temporal ruler reigning over all followers of Ormazd. Instead, they believe the faithful should derive guidance directly from the writings of Mulhaed al-Quyat and the other Prophets. Normally a minor sect with few public followers, the Kitabids often find their ranks swelling when a new Calif arises, as rulers who do not wish to become subjects of the Calif flock to their banner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampiric_DESC;By nature, vampires tend to turn their backs to any and all Gods, since anything or any place consecrated to a deity ( Even to the dreaded Dark Gods of Chaos ) can hurt them considerably. Instead, each Bloodline greatly respects their ancient founders, bordering outright on worship some times. Neferata, W'soran, Abhorash, Vashanesh, Ushoran, Harakhte and Maatmeses are all venerated and feared by their respective bloodlines. In the end, though, the only god a Vampire truly believes in is in itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
horned_rat_DESC;The Horned Rat is the sole God of the Skaven, for He will tolerate no others. His symbol is a equilateral triangle and his sacred number is 13. Usually, the Horned Rat is represented as a giant rat with curved horns. Even though he is not allied to the other Chaos Gods, He is undoubtedly one of them. The Pillar of Commandments is held his most sacred gift to his children, the Skaven, and candidates to the Council of the Thirteen must pass His judgement by touching it. The Grey Seers are His prophets, who preach of the "Great Ascendancy" a time where all Skaven will rise to the surface and finally enslave all of its dwellers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asrai_cadai_DESC;The Wood Elves worship roughly the same Gods as their cousins from Ulthuan, but with some theological differences. The Asrai place more emphasis on the worship of Kurnous, the Hunter, and his wife Isha, the Mother. To the Wood Elves, the whole forest of Athel Loren a temple to Kurnous and Isha, but holy places can be found deep in the forest, special clearings which are recognisable only to those who truly worship them. Small shrines to Asuryan can also be found through Athel Loren, but none close the great temples of Ulthuan. The King and Queen of the Asrai, Orion and Ariel, are respectively the living avatars of Kurnous and Isha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shallyan_DESC;Shallya is the Goddess of Healing and Mercy, and sister to Myrmidia. Her most well known symbol is a white dove with its wing spread, holding a key in its beak. Worship of Shallya is widespread all around the Old World, and its very popular amongst the Bretonnian peasantry. Her priesthood is the Order of the Bleeding Heart, mostly composed by women. Priestesses of Shallya are expected lead a life according to Her strictures of pacifism and mercy, and their temples are usually hospitals, orphanages and asylums as well. The head of the cult is the Most Holy Matriarch of Couronne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
false_grail_DESC;All would-be Kings of Bretonnia must conduct the sacred Quest and drink from the Grail in order to receive the Blessing of the Lady, and be crowned by the Fey Enchantress. Through Bretonnian history, some unscrupulous pretenders have been known to find "grail" sof dubious authenticity in order to claim Kingship for themselves. The peasantry, and a large part of the nobility, are usually fooled by these false champions, but the Grail Knights, whose connection with the true Grail is unquestionable, aren't deceived, and will usually start a civil war to depose these false Kings as soon as possible. The Lady is known to retire her blessings of protection from these usurpers and their land, which will become a cursed ground, home to evil men and dark beasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anath_raema_DESC;Anath Raema is an Elven deity who is said to be the sister of Khaine and holds the position of being the goddess of the savage hunt. It is believed that she instilled the joy of the chasing and killing victims to the Dark Elves with the identity of their prey not being of importance. Instead, the blood thirsty goddess enjoys the thrill of the hunt with any living being prey to her. She is said to hold a belt with the hands and heads of the hunters that called upon her aid but never thanked her for her assistance. Anath Raema is said to have made advances to Kurnous only to be spurned by him which is why she is also seen as the patron of jealous lovers who hunts down those that have wronged her followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
greenskin_gods_2_desc;The Greenskins are a superstitious bunch, and so, they worship a myriad of minor Gods and fetishes, but far above these lesser spirits and trinkets stand Gork and Mork, the true kings of the Greenskin pantheon. They are not worshipped in the weak fashion of the other races, instead all Greenskins look up to the deeds of the twin gods for inspiration. In these tales, Gork is brutally cunning and Mork is cunningly brutal, though the Greenskins tend to fight over which one is what, as they do with everything else. Shamans are in direct ( And some times, violent ) contact with Gork & Mork, and are even able to summon them in battle in order to crush their enemies or support the other Greenskins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nagashi_DESC;Nagash was the first Necromancer, and was arguably among the most powerful Magic users of all time. He caused the destruction of the civilization of Nehekhara and brought about the creation of the Undead, notably creating the first 11 Vampires of which only 7 are known to the man of the present day, and also unintentionally raised the Tomb Kings from their rest. Some of the Vampire bloodlines still follow his teachings and anyone willing to dabble in the art of Necromancy will end up, sooner or later, to fall under his influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kukaili_DESC;Kukaili, the Great Devourer, is the bloody and callous deity of the Miyan tribes of Lustria. Miyan legends tell that, much like the Old Ones, Kukaili came from the stars, though their legends don't specify whether it is an Old One or something else. The Miyan will often celebrate great rituals where they ritualistically devour their prisoners to honor their savage god. It is said, that somewhere deep within the jungle, the Miyan feed prisoners to Kukaili's "mouths", endless gaping pits, full of jagged teeth. While its worship is mostly confined to the Miyan, many escaped male Amazon slaves also have turned to worship it as means to seek revenge against their former oppressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
draconite_DESC;The Cathayans believe the Celestial Dragons to be the embodiments of Nature and Fate and worship them as gods. Barred a few exceptions, their deities seldom involve themselves directly into the affairs of mortals and the nature of their interactions can be as destructive as it can be benevolent, depending on the situation and the dragon involved. Xen Huong, the Heavenly Emperor, which is associated with Life and Fate, is one of the most active Cathayan gods and official ruler of their realm. Although foreigners tend to assume that he is the main or only deity, Cathayans try and balance their offerings to please all their Celestial Masters. Other preeminent figures in the Cathayan pantheon are Yaen and Yein, Siblings of Strife and Conquest, Xao Saen, the Sleeping One, Fa Xeng, the Firegiver and Zan Long, the Ordainer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
shadowmen_DESC;Not all of the Southlanders accepted the coming of Ormazd. Many of the Bayaji and Wasai tribesmen feared that the magic of the One could not cast away the dread of the Shadowlands and that opposing the Carrion Children would have done nothing but angering them, if not disrupted their sacred charge as protectors of the Shadowrealm. Whereas the Akghan have merged local animism and foreign beliefs and think their spells are the only ward they need against darkness, the Shadowmen stay true to their ancestral heritage, dabbling in voodoo and necromancy to contact and appease the Carrion Children as a way to avoid their wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
great_maw_DESC;The Ogres worship an all-devouring god known as The Great Maw. Their relationship is not just one of devotion, but also one of fear, for the Great Maw was once responsible for the near destruction of the Ogre race. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
