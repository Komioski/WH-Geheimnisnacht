WeAreDoomed;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VeryWeakDoom;The priests are clear. At the moment, the Winds of Chaos are very weak, but they may grow stronger as war, sickness, and conflict continues to rage across the mortal world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
WeakDoom;The omens of doom have been increasing of late. While not yet at apocalyptic levels, the Winds of Chaos seem to be growing - though for now, they are still weak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ModerateDoom;The priesthood is divided, but their auguries indicate the Winds of Chaos have reached moderately strong levels, where it is much easier for daemons to enter the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
StrongDoom;Strange storms afflict the world, sometimes accompanied by the laughter of daemons. Other chaotic phenomena have been increasing as well. The signs are clear - the Winds of Chaos are strong at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VeryStrongDoom;Dark clouds of unnatural colour constantly hover over the northern horizon, and the winds carry the laughter and cries of daemons. Dark dreams trouble your citizens, and the priests are saying the End Times are near.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
