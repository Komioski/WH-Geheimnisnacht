# MELEE DUEL OUTCOMES
#
#
# BOTH PARTICIPANTS ARE MELEE FIGHTERS
#
#
# Three outcomes (2 descriptions per one)
#
# Outcome 1 : Maim
GetDuelOutcome_MeleeMaim;The fight starts off fiercely, as the clashing of metal is violent enough to quiet the murmurs of the spectators. For a while it seems like neither of you will gain the upper hand, until you manage to parry [enemy.GetBestName]'s blow and deliver a powerful strike to [enemy.GetHerHis] defensless arm. [enemy.GetSheHeCap] drops [enemy.GetHerHis] weapon on the ground and lets out a blood-curdling scream, staring in shock at the gruesome wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Outcome 2 : Force to surrender outcome in melee
GetDuelOutcome_MeleeOverpower;[enemy.GetBestName] starts aggressively, but you manage to evade and block the attacks [enemy.GetSheHe] hurls at you. Over time you gain the advantage, while your opponent is getting more and more fatigued. Finally you feint a high attack and [enemy.GetBestName] falls for it, failing to block as you strike out towards [enemy.GetHerHis] unprotected legs. Once injured, [enemy.GetSheHe] surrenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Outcome 3 : Winner outcome decapitation
GetDuelOutcome_MeleeDeath;You finally face off with [enemy.GetBestName]. You already know that you will stand victorious, as such a weak creature cannot possibly pose a challenge to someone like you. It's clear that [enemy.GetBestName] isn't confident in [enemy.GetHerHis] chances, as [enemy.GetSheHe] charges you and desperately swings at your garde. Easily evading the mindless slashes, you quickly end the fight by surprising your opponent with an elegant dodge, coming up behind [enemy.GetHerHim] and dealing a deadly blow to [enemy.GetHerHis] neck, decapitating [enemy.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Outcome 1 : loser: Melee maim
GetDuelOutcomeLoser_MeleeMaim; The fight starts off fiercely as neither of you hold back, the echo of clashing metal following every brutal attack. For a long time it's unclear who will stand victorious, until a parry throws you off balance, leaving you an open target. [From.GetBestName] instantly strikes out, and an eruption of pain ravages your body as their blade digs deep into your arm. You let out a blood-curdling scream, and the duel is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Outcome 2: loser : Melee Overpower
GetDuelOutcomeLoser_MeleeOverpower;The duel starts violently, as your tactic is to strike at [From.GetBestName]'s garde repeatedly until it folds. However, you seem to be unable to overwhelm [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] blocks and evades your every attack with ease. As time passes you grow more and more fatigued, and predicting [From.GetBestName]'s maneuvers gets all the more challenging. You curse your slow reactions as you try to parry a high attack, which [From.GetSheHe] used to feint into a low blow, striking at your legs. The resulting wound isn't fatal, but it hinders your movement and you reluctantly yield to your opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Outcome 3: loser :  Melee Death
GetDuelOutcomeLoser_MeleeDeath;You're well aware of your own ability, or lack of thereof, and therefore know that your duel with [From.GetBestName] will be onesided. Hoping to get the upper hand through surprise, you charge them the second they appear on the battleground. However, your sudden move doesn't faze them, and your desperate stabs are being easily parried. As [From.GetBestName] dodges one of your high blows, they get plenty of time to come up behind you and slash at your neck. There's no time to feel pain, as you fade from this world much too quickly to register your head being separated from the rest of your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Outcome 4: symmetrical :  Draw both killed
GetDuelOutcomeDraw_MeleeDeath;You charge at [enemy.GetBestName] as soon as the duel begins. [enemy.GetSheHeCap] is equally aggressive, and delivers vicious blows that you barely manage to evade. You hear the people that have gathered to watch your brawl gasp at the fury that is displayed. Their horror isn't surprising, since both of you manage to land more than a handful blows on each-other, causing injuries that would bring a less passionate man to his knees. The duel rages on as both of you refuse to yield, and soon enough you manage to slash [enemy.GetFirstName] in the side, causing a fatal wound. For a moment you seem victorious, but as your rage subsides, you're overwhelmed by pain. Looking down, you find [enemy.GetFirstName]'s blade driven straight through your stomach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
