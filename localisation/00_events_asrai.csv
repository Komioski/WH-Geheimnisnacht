enter_oak_of_ages_desc;The eternal cycle ensuring the survival of Athel Loren must be preserved. The gods will protect the forests, as long as there are volunteers amongst the Asrai to become their vessels. You currently claim rule over Athel Loren, yet have refused thus far such burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

spouseenter_oak_of_ages_desc;The eternal cycle ensuring the survival of Athel Loren must be preserved. The Gods will protect the forests, as long as there are volunteers amongst the Asrai to become their vessels. You currently bear such burden, yet your spouse is still free from it. For balance to be reached, Isha and Kurnous must be reunited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEasrai1;The Oak of Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai1;As days go by, you've felt drawn closer to the heart of Athel Loren, the Oak of the Ages. You've finally embraced the call of the Gods and, as you enter the the ancient tree, you feel the benevolence and wisdom of Isha filling your very being. What happens later is indescribable, but when you've come out you've become more than a mere elf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai1;As days go by, you've felt drawn closer to the heart of Athel Loren, the Oak of the Ages. You've finally embraced the call of the Gods and, as you enter the the ancient tree, you feel the wrath and righteousness of Kurnous filling your very being. What happens later is indescribable, but when you've come out you've become more than a mere elf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai1;Let my enlightened guide shine over my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai1;Let the Wild Hunt start anew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai2;Winter is coming closer and once again you feel the call of the Oak of Ages, to rest inside the heart of Athel Loren and wait for your forces to be renewed on spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai2;Winter is coming closer and once again you feel the call of the Oak of Ages, to burn, die and be reborn from  the heart of Athel Loren in spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCasrai2;The summer is coming to an end and you feel more and more tired everyday. The call of Athel Loren compels you to yield to your torpor and sleep until the next spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai2;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai2;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai2;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai3;With the spring giving new life and colour to the woods, you emerge once more from your sleep, reinvigorated by the power of Athel Loren, once more ready to defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai3;The Hunt draws close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai4;Something is wrong. You've awakened with a strange thirst for blood this year. The minds of all the Great Hunters are shrieking inside your mind, demanding for you to protect the sacred glades and slaughter all those who are planning to do harm upon them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai4;Blow the horns! It is time we hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai5;This year Kurnous has come back to life maddened with lust for blood. Already his call resonates over the glades, calling all the creatures of the forest to hunt, driving spirits and beasts insane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai5;Blreaaarh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai5;The horns pierce my ears!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai5;What's all this ruckus about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai6;The Weave is out of balance. Day after day you hear whispers and shrieks beneath your bark, it becomes harder to focus, to keep calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai6;Blreaaarh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai8;Athel Loren is not kind on those who fail to respect and preserve its boundaries. The branches and leaves twist and reach out by their own will and by the blink of an eye, part of your hold has disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai8;What- where...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai9;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai9;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai10;You search your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for days, losing four more scouts to the treacherous forest, before finally admitting defeat. The terrible and ancient spirits of Athel Loren claimed [From.GetHerHim], your blasphemy has condemned your [GetFromRelation] to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai10;Why!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai11;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai12;After the third day of your [GetFromRelation] avoiding you, you finally manage to discover what was the cause of [From.GetHerHis] shyness. The spirits, angered by your actions, have carved their resentment into [From.GetHerHis] face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai12;This is... Oh-ugh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai13;Wondering in the woods of Athel Loren by yourself is not the most sensible action. Yet there you are, unaware of how or why did you leave the glade of your [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai13;Where am I? Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai14;You search your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for days, losing four more scouts to the treacherous forest, before finally admitting defeat. The terrible and ancient spirits of Athel Loren claimed [From.GetHerHim], your blasphemy has condemned your [GetFromRelation] to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai14;Your young innocent [GetFromRelation] has disappeared. The cruel and terrible spirits of Athel Loren claimed what was more dear to you to punish you for your blasphemy, condemning the poor soul to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai14;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai15;You awake in your bed, something rasping under the sheets. You cannot see nor touch your attacker, but at the same time you feel its cold claws pierce their way beneath your flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai15;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai16;You awake in your bed, something rasping under the sheets. You cannot see nor touch your attacker, but at the same time you feel its cold claws pierce their way beneath your flesh, searching for your eyes and your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai16;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai17;You awake in your bed, something rasping under the sheets. You cannot see nor touch your attacker, but at the same time you feel its cold claws pierce their way beneath your flesh, breaking bones and maiming limbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai17;Grlllbllch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai18;Wandering in the woods of Athel Loren by yourself is not the most sensible action. Yet there you are, unaware of how or why did you leave the safety of your hold. Voices whisper and a faint laughter echoes through the leaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai18;Where am I? Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai19;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai19;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai20;You search your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for days, losing four more scouts to the treacherous forest, before finally admitting defeat. The terrible and ancient spirits of Athel Loren claimed [From.GetHerHim], your blasphemy has condemned your [GetFromRelation] to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai20;Why!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai21;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai21;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai22;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been missing for some days. Many in the court have come to the conclusion [From.GetSheHe] has been taken by the spirits of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai22;It'll probably come back sooner or later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai23;You cannot sleep, you cannot think, the shrieking voices of the angered spirits follow your steps at every turn. As days pass by, you feel losing your grip on sanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai23;Leave me alone! Alone!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
appease_spirits;Appease Spirits;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
appease_spirits_desc;Offer a sacrifice in order to appease the capricious spirits of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai24;The spirits of Athel Loren are mysterious and capricious entities, all too ready to kill and twist any creature that dares entering their holy woods. You can only hope an offering could placate them, for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai24;A great offering for our friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai24;The greatest gift for our friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai24;I've changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai25;It is hard to read the forest's disposition, but as your offering vanishes, you can feel the Weave resonates with approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai25;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai26;It is hard to read the forest's disposition. In a day, your offering has disappeared, but not sign has come from the spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai26;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai27;Your end has not come yet. Inflamed by your righteous anger, your spirit flew back to the heart of Athel Loren, to be reborn from the hulk of a deadwood as twisted Tree Kin, ready to exact vengeance upon your enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai27;Raahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai28;It has become harder and harder to recall the memories of your previous life. The call of the forest is ever stronger and you feel your conciousness finally going away, merging with the Weave of the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai28;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai29;It has become harder and harder to recall the memories of your previous life. The call of the forest is ever stronger but you feel you could still maintain yourself apart from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai29;It is time to join the Weave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai29;It's not my time yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspellsinger1;The Weave allowed an old spellsinger to wander into your glade. The traveller has little memory of what brought them here, but they are ready to put themselves unto your service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger1;It's a sign. They are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger1;It might be cursed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.2;All the children of Asuryan are connected to the Weave, but you've always felt a special link to the forest. Maybe your guardian could teach you to sharpen your senses and learn proper magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.2;I'll be a wise Spellsinger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.3;For some time your [GetFromRelation] has bothered you, asking if you could teach [From.GetHerHim] how to link with the Weave and cast spells.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.3;You could have some potential...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.3;Get lost. This is not a game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.4;You've spent years on books of ancient lore, meditating in the depths of the forest, searching for a vision from the spirits, but to no avail. Your results in magic study has been less than mediocre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.4;No point continuing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.7;My [GetFromRelation] refused to teach you magic, claiming you've not the prerequisites to handle such a dangerous power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.7;I could! How could you say that?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.8;All in Athel Loren is about balance, summer and winter, death and rebirth, light and darkness. The endless cycles of the great seasons determine the existence of all beings. The Asrai understand the delicate nature of the Weave and do not shun from embracing all of its forms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.8;I will follow the lightened path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.8;I will follow the dark path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspellsinger.8005;The more time passes, the more it appears clear your student has decided to shun darkness and embrace the path of the Lightweaver, to heal the sickness and corruption that may tarnish the forest and preserve its pureness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspellsinger.8005;The more time passes, the more it appears clear your student has decided to shun light and embrace the path of the Darkweaver, to twist and instil terror upon those who would do harm to Athel Loren and threaten it's immaculate purity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.8005;I'm proud of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.8005;That's... Still acceptable, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.16;Your guardian has decided to take you as an apprentice and teach you in the ways of the Weave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.16;I'll soon be a powerful Spellsinger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.17;Spellsingers are the powerful magic-users of the Asrai. They tap into the Weave of Athel Loren and through this bond they can reshape the forest around them. After your long studies, you've been acknowledged as a learned mage of the Asrai people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOTAspellsinger.17;The forest speaks to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.19;You've taught much of what you know to your [GetFromRelation] in the past few years and now you wonder if [From.GetSheHe] is ready to be recognized as a full mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.19;The time has come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.19;Not really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.20;Your [GetFromRelation] has finally acknowledged, after many years of study, that [From.GetSheHe] is proud to call you a Spellsinger, no longer a mere apprentice of the arcane arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.20;Yet there's still so much to learn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.21;There are many things that a mage-to-be should know to protect himself from the dangers of sorcery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger21;A Spellsinger should discern light from darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger21;A Spellsinger should always strive for perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspellsinger21;A Spellsinger should never lose his calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspellsinger21;Let's just focus on magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.22;In the past weeks you've spent several hours discussing with your [GetFromRelation] about how a Spellsinger should keep his mind clear and judge reality in an impartial way, so as to not be deceived by the corruption of Chaos or the lies of inferior beings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger22;Of course, it's objective we are the enlightened kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.23;In the past weeks you've spent several hours discussing with your [GetFromRelation] about how a Spellsinger should always work at his best to perfect his art, study new spells, assure himself of correct ritual and so on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger23;I wouldn't want to blow up anything. By mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.24;In the past weeks you've spent several hours discussing with your [GetFromRelation] about how a Spellsinger should always keep his calm, lest his passion might cloud his senses and twist his spells against him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger24;But isn't passion that gives purpose to the Hunt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.100;You've lingered in the darkness for so long, its taint has started to obfuscate your senses, filling you with irrational hate and impure thoughts. Balance must be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger100;Light to compensate Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger100;I shall endure nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.101;Your [GetFromRelation] is plagued by [From.GetHerHis] tidings to the dark powers. As a Lightweaver it is your duty to restore the balance of [From.GetHerHis] soul so that [From.GetSheHe] can continue to serve the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger101;I will prepare the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.102;The ritual of [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to tame your troubled soul. Once again the dark powers are entrapped and tied by your will, ready to be unleashed only against the enemies of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.102;And soon they will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.103;Despite [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s best efforts, you're still plagued by bloodied visions and twisted dreams. The dark powers you've always called upon to flay your enemies are now consuming your very soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.103;I *will* contain them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAaicleanup010;Your spell has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai31;You've stained your hands with the blood of Isha, such a blasphemous act echoes across the Weave, setting the spirits into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai31;You've stained your hands with the blood of Kurnous, such a blasphemous act echoes across the Weave, setting the spirits into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCasrai31;You've stained your hands with the blood of a spirit, such a blasphemous act echoes across the Weave, setting the other entities of Athel Loren into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai31;What have I done!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai31;Bleaarrk'k'k'k!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai32;[FromFrom.GetFirstName], one of the mysterious and treacherous Fair Folk, has taken hold of your [GetFromRelation], with no intention of ever giving [From.GetHerHim] back to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai33;You've spent so much time within the magic and mysterious lands of the Elves, that it's hard to remember any other life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai33;Where I belong to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai34;Now that your ward is reaching adulthood, you've started to notice how the once delicate features of the child have started being spoiled by the obscene traits of [From.GetHerHis] lesser nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai34;Send this thing back from whence it came.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai34;I'm still fond of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai36;You've brought your glorious host through the province of [From.GetName]. What should be done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai36;Let nothing stand in our way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai36;Dread carefully in these foreign lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai37;The merciless riders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have wrought destruction and ruin in your lands, destroying any building they came across and hunting down people like beasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai37;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai38;The merciless riders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have wrought destruction and ruin in [FromFrom.GetName], destroying any building they came across and hunting down people like beasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai38;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai36;Pick the interesting ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai39;The merciless riders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have wrought destruction and ruin in your lands, hunting down the people like beasts, rounding up some of them and leaving in a magical mist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai39;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spirit_reinforcements;Call Spirits;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
spirit_reinforcements_desc;You lead several of the spirits of Athel Loren, call for their help in your battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai44;The great and old [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has shown interest in your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. It's clear the spirit desires to drag [From.GetHerHim] forever in the depths of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai44;All, to our friends from beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai44;No, not [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
opinion_spirit_angered;Angered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai41;An old spirit from the depths of the forest has decided to honour your glade with its presence, bringing the might of its host to your defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai41;And we graciously thank our new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai46;Your disrespectful attitude has angered on of the old spirits resting within your glade to the point of [From.GetHerHim] deciding to leave in disgust, along with [From.GetHerHis] host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai46;I'm so sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai47;An elusive and sombre group of Elves passed by one of your camps last evening, informing one of your captains that they will join your forces against a common enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai47;We welcome any help from our distant cousins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasrai47;Welcome, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai47;As if some small help will make us forget!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai47;Who are these people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
summon_spirits;Summon Spirit Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
summon_spirits_desc;You have a direct link with the mysterious forces governing Athel Loren. You can use it to call for a spirit host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai49;The spirits have been deaf to your call. Nobody came.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai49;They have abandoned us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai50;A host of saplings and dryads appears from the forest, rallying to your banners, ready to attack the enemies of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai50;Let us hunt together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai51;A host of spirits, led by old tree men appears from the forest, rallying to your banners, ready to attack the enemies of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai51;The Weave blesses us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai52;The summer has passed, and the spirits of your army start to fall to the torpor of winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
