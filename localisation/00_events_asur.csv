EVTDESCHIGHELF.1;While on a border patrol, a courtier's small force was ambushed, but [From.GetSheHe] fled and left [From.GetHerHis] men to die! [From.GetHerHisCap] name is in disgrace, and [From.GetSheHe] has shamed our entire court with [From.GetHerHis] cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTHIGHELF.2.b;It reminds me of the first light of a winter moon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.2;This courtier has composed a stunning new epic, which brings tears to the eyes of anyone who hears it. At the feast table, even hardened warriors are seen with misty eyes, reminiscing of the glories of your ancient race.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.3.b;No, I think I'll sit this one out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.3;Foul creatures such as manticores and hydras sometimes make their way down from the Anulii mountains. Your huntmaster is arranging a great hunt, do you wish to join in it and perhaps win a new trophy for the walls of your feast hall?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.4.a;Who am I to go against tradition?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.4;While the Phoenix King is the political centre of Ulthuan, the Everqueen is its spiritual heart. It is tradition that they have a year-long ritual marriage and produce a daughter who shall be the next Everqueen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCasur1;The priestesses make sure you are ready by casting the proper protective spells, and you leap into the flames that will consecrate you as the rightful ruler of Ulthuan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAasur2;Asuryan blesses me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur3;You enter the flames with a steady heart, but the Gods do not favour you today. Asuryan's gaze passes through your protective spells and your flesh is scourged with fire. The priestesses manage to recover you, shrieking and maimed, but the will of the Gods has been made clear today, you are not the rightful heir to the Phoenix Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur3;AAAARGH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur4;You enter the flames with a steady heart, but the Gods do not favour you today. Asuryan's gaze passes through your protective spells and your flesh is scourged with fire.

EVTOPTBasur6;He was burned for crossing a fire. So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur7;Your [GetFromRelation] was burned by the holy Flames of Asuryan, disgracing his whole line along with himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAasur8;How could this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur9;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to pass through the Flames of Asuryan, but the God saw his wickedness and burned him, leaving nothing but a blackened carcass in his wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur9;A false king has been revealed by the righteous gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBasur9;Why did he even cross the fire in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur10;Your [GetFromRelation] was burned by the holy Flames of Asuryan, dying a horrible death and disgracing his whole bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur10;But I'm not tainted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAasur12;He is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBasur12;Shame befalls him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_spleasure2;You've always prized your impeccable poetic skills. Yet, as of late, you've had more and more trouble with inspiration. The dreaded fear and cold sophistication of Druchii architecture and the damp forests of Naggaroth can only be applied for so long after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure2;Maybe I could try taking... something... to enhance my point of view?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure2;It is said suffering helps the poet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure2;I'm sure I'll find something, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure3;It's not easy to find certain philtres in Ulthuan, but alchemists have to use all sorts of reagents for their experiments. In the end you were able to find and make use of what you needed. The thrill itself was enough to tingle your senses, but the experience right after was something indescribable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure3;The New World is filled with strange plants and fungi used for certain rituals, it didn't take long for you to find what you needed. In the end you were able to find and make use of what you needed. The thrill itself was enough to tingle your senses, but the experience right after was something indescribable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure3;I can touch the Winds of Magic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure4;You spend sometime wondering the moral ramifications of your action, but in the end, you agree with yourself it can be an enriching experience. As you observe life slowly dripping away from your wrists, you experience an unfathomable new sensation. When you finally press the wound closed, what you've lost in blood, you've gained tenfold in inspiration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure4;It's not something unheard of amongst Khaine followers after all. As you observe life slowly dripping away from your wrists, you experience an unfathomable new sensation. When you finally press the wound closed, what you've lost in blood, you've gained tenfold in inspiration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure4;What if I used it instead of ink? How deep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure5;You can see the hordes of daemonic hordes riding over your fingers. They are so distinct... Yet they're fading away already, you need more of the substance. You can't come unprepared when they come back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure5;They're still on my hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure6;You could have touched the heavenly figure, it was right in front of you, so alluring... Yet now she has disappeared, you need more of the substance. Reality has become so dull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure6;Where's my dust?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure7;You pick a fruit from the heavenly garden, yet, when put it between your lips it turns into your finger. The effects are fading again, you need more of the substance. Reality has become so dull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure7;Where did I leave it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure8;Your multiple experiences really opened your mind, you can see things in such a broad spectrum. As long as you take more of the substance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure8;Yes, yes, I see all now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure9;It took you a while to notice, but as got out of your drug-induced trance, you glanced at the servant peeling from the curtains, spying on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure9;He can join me, there's enough of it for two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure9;Want to see something? *Grab him*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure9;Maybe it's time to stop with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure10;The servant appears scared at first, but once you force him to inhale some of your ailment, he calms himself, happily joining you. The experience is even better with someone else, maybe you should convince more people to join in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10;Yes, just let your mind roam...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPspleasure10;[Root.GetFirstName] unlocked the targeted decision 'Twist'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure11;You drag the servant across the floor and press his face into your last bag of dust, leaving him shaking and choking. After some time, he finally stops, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure11;How do you like that? What is your *soul* seeing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure12;Each day you give thanks for the inspiration that has led you thus far but although you still feel the thrill when pain dances across your flesh, as time goes on you long to feel something even harsher. As you wonder this things, you find yourself soothed by the chirping of a lovely songbird scampering near your window. For a while you simply delight in its song but eventually your thoughts begin to turn and you start to wonder if perhaps you could inspire it to even greater heights of artistry. How much more beautiful and moving would it be if he went to the same suffering as you subordinate yourself to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure12;I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure12;That's base, I'll cleanse this thought from my flesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure12;That's enough, never again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure13;It's growing faint so quickly, but you cannot deny the unique and sublime tone given to birds' notes. It might have been its last song, but you're brought to tears by that very perfection you helped it reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure13;It was... enchanting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure14;You start punishing your own flesh, but as you go on, you start seeing the art of your work, the passion inside every cut. You quickly grab a mirror and start drawing red lines over your face, ecstatic at the sight of your coming masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure14;Sublime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure15;Your scholarly studies give you plenty of time for peaceful contemplation and the enjoyment of solitude. All alone in the great library, you cannot fail to think of the books as little universes, hanging to your whims, depending on your care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure15;A slight change here or there, and history itself is rewritten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure15;Like the world, they could have little daemons roaming inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure15;They should always be preserved at their best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure16;You smirk, complimenting yourself on your work and passing to the next volume. So many great deeds were committed by your ancestors you didn't know about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure16;It's like bending time itself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure17;Another little miniature is ready and you move to look for a good spot for the next one. They are so well hidden. The future generations will look at the marvels of these pages and ignore the obscenities laughing at them from the paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure17;It's so delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pompous, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, giving you sleazy looks every time he thinks you're not watching him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pretentious, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, outrageously flirting as if her very presence was a gift to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure18;It's a vast and ancient library one could easily get lost in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure18;Let's see if the brat can really handle what it craves for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure18;Walking close to the staircase, I see? Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure18;I'll just have to bear with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure19;Who knows when the poor student is getting out of the old storage room. It's so dark and twisted, how could the brat even end there, you wonder? Here's to hoping the poor soul doesn't get eaten by rats. On the other hand, his muffled screams for help are so soothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure19;It sounds like a lullaby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The boy turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with him assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The girl turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with her assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure20;A teacher *should* spank their students from time to time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure21;It takes just one little trip. You have to bear the squealing voice of the annoying twerp only up to when the brat's head squashes on the floor below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure21;What a beautiful silence. Poetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure22;You were doing some testing for a new concoction in your laboratory, but something has gone wrong. The rat you used for your experiment has started to slowly and painfully choke after tasting the substance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure22;This needs to be closely observed, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure22;I'll check on it later, let's try something else first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure22;Better to end the poor creature's suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure23;Despite your careful examination, you cannot find the source of the problem. You have to admit to yourself though, watching the creature gasping for its last breath from above, like a passive deity, filled you with a smug sense of satisfaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure23;It just comes with the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure24;When you return with a new mix, you find out the rat has not yet drawn its last breath. You have it ingest the new substance and while the creature dies, there's a series of fascinating side-effects accompanying its death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure24;How interesting. I'll need another rat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25;You really looked forward the visit of your distant colleague, you'd had a thrilling correspondence in the last months. Yet, now that you have him here, you are starting to seriously question your judgement. The short-sighted fool is dismissing many of your accomplishments, accusing you of using experiments just as a pretence to kill and torture your test subjects. He has even started to threaten you to call authorities to have you answer of some of these supposed transgressions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25;Your brain doesn't work. Let me check it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure25;Allow me then to show you this great brew I tested on rats some time ago...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure25;Maybe he's right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25005;Your colleague finally stops twitching. Some more stitches and he'll be free to go. Of course he was belittling you, the lymph determining his pride and envy were cluttering his brain, you had to remove an entire piece to cure him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25005;Ssshhh, it's all over now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure26;There's no real difference. Like the rat, the scholar can only look at you from below now, in awe and terror, as he chokes on his own blood. The post-mortem reactions seem to be considerably different from your last tests with rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure26;I should try it with more people then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure27;Since your youth you've been admired for your intelligence. Yet, at the same time, when you've put it into practice, you've always had people complain and snort, opting for the most stupid of decisions. Like the minor noble in front of you right now, bragging about his mediocre accomplishments and calling your wisdom cowardice and self-entitlement. Why gifted people such as you should suffer idiots of his sort?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure27;If you so desire, I'll humiliate you right now in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure27;Speak on, I'll speak later, to the right people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure27;If I answered in kind, I'd be as stupid as he is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure28;When you're finished with him, the courtier is so ashamed he cannot spit a word back. As if it wasn't enough recounting his many failings, you inflame the court against him and he's soon driven out by shouts and threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure28;See?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure29;Seeing you not answering him, the courtier keeps on bragging, finally leaving the room when satisfied with his work. In a few days you send your people to the countryside, spreading enough vicious rumours to utterly destroy his reputation, while at the same time maintaining yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure29;That's where the genius lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure30;The events at court in the last weeks still haunt you. The thrill, the satisfaction of having the entire court hanging from your lips, then pitted against that insufferable idiot... It wouldn't be bad to feel it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure30;There's plenty of fools, it's only a question of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure30;No, it's not warranted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure31;You are about to send another peasant off to his ironic and well fitted punishment, when one of your spies comes whispering into your ears the bragging courtier is dead by his own hand. He committed suicide to escape the shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure31;Ah! Thus proving once more what a fool he was!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure32;You've always had a sweet tooth and enjoyed foods of all sorts, filling your belly with exotic delicacies gives you an indescribable sense of satisfaction. Yet many at court frown on your taste as inappropriate for an Elven noblewoman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCC_spleasure32;You've always exercised caution and moderation in your meals, as befitting an Elven noblewoman, yet sometimes it's really hard to say no to some new delicacy, have your stomach growl and be content with roots and vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure32;You've always exercised caution and moderation in your meals, as befitting an Elven nobleman, yet sometimes it's really hard to say no to some new delicacy, have your stomach growl and be content with roots and vegetables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure32;Nobody can deny you enjoy a good celebration every once in a while. The thing is, as of late, nothing seems to excite you anymore. After years of experience, it seems you're out of ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure32;They're wrong, I don't care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure32;Maybe I could use a little moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure32;A little indulgence won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure32;No, I'm committed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure32;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure32;Well, that happens when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure33;Why did you even doubt yourself? This is the way you like spending your life. Why negate some simple pleasure to try and reach the unattainable ideal of Elven beauty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure33;They are just bones wrapped in judgemental skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure34;Having to let yourself go for a while was nice and all, but now you worry if you're not overdoing with all the large meals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure34;Just one more snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure35;Your wild feast seems a success, there's all sort of grotesque entertainment going on, things to make an Asur blush. You're having the time of your life, when some stupid page has the gall to voice his absolute repulsion for the whole spectacle, calling your guests weakling sycophants and you a depraved vixen with no shame, as if being the only one in the room to be still dressed gave him more nobility than the one in your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure35;Pile on him! Pile on him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure35;Maybe we've gone a tad bit too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure36;When you wake up in the morning in the garden, naked and wrapped around in a fur cloak by the statue of an Elven God-like, you can barely remember what exactly happened the night before. One thing was clear: it was awesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure36;And whatever happened to that servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure37;Ignoring the courtiers' prattling seemed to quell your conscience for some time, yet now you are starting to notice how less and less dresses fit you and how tiring moving has become. You can barely fit your behind on the throne any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure37;I don't mind, it's all so good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure37;What am I becoming? Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure38;Why others even care so much? Should you starve yourself like a peasant? They're only envious of you, that's all, they know what they're missing out. Maybe you should show them, some time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure38;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure39;The Gods teach moderation and abstinence, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure39;Khaine is not soft on weakness, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure39;You've always followed the austere dictates of the Gods, always kept your mind clear to better fight corruption and Chaos. Yet, sometimes you envy the simple joys of inebriation and carousing. Would it be so wrong to give into it once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure39;You've never let your guard down and kept your mind clear and sharp to fight your enemies. Yet, sometimes you envy the simple joys of inebriation and carousing. Would it be so wrong to give into it once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure39;Nobody can deny you enjoy a good celebration every once in a while. The thing is, as of late, nothing seems to excite you anymore. After years of experience, it seems you're out of ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure39;I'll drink to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure39;Maybe I should spend more time sober...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure39;A little sip won't really hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure39;Doesn't matter. Can't afford to risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure39;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure39;Well, the desensitization comes when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure40;Why worry about the Gods? Surely they drink too from time to time. You remember seeing a statue of one holding a bottle. Or did you put it there one of your nights out? The memory is blurry right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure40;If it fitted, it means *he* wanted it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure41;Since you started drinking, every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor. How could you miss all this for so long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure41;Ah ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure42;Your wild feast seems a success, there's all sort of grotesque entertainment going on, things to make an Asur blush.

EVTOPTAspleasure43;And whatever happened to that servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure44;As a mockery from the Gods themselves, the sense of inebriation has started to fade in the last days. Doesn't matter how much you drink, you can only get so little enjoyment from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure44;Time to move to something stronger than alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure44;It's probably a sign of mercy. Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure45;You were right, alcohol was just the tip of a great new universe of sensation you've unlocked. There are so many substances, so many ways to see the world... And those narrow-minded fools see it as weakness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure45;I could show them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure46;Asur frown upon the weak temptation of the flesh, yet you've always had a hard time adhering to this principle. Even worst, recently nothing seems to satisfy your lust anymore. Luckily a bard that has recently come to your court gave you a good impression he could help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Luckily a bard that has recently come to your court gave you a good impression he could help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure46;Druchii women aren't exactly known for their modesty and you are no exception. Yet your lust has run somewhat dry in the last years, nothing seems to enflame it anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure46;Druchii don't mind employing all of their skills to get the favour of a Sorceress or some other Matriarch, that doesn't mean one should not enjoy the process of getting it. Sadly, as of late, you've had a hard time satisfying your lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCE_spleasure46;You've always been praised by other Asur for your modesty and for how gracefully you've protected your virtue. Yet, from time to time, you have... yearnings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCF_spleasure46;You've always been praised by other Asur for your clear-mindedness and for how gracefully and respectfully you've treated the opposite sex. Yet, from time to time you wonder how could it be to act as some lesser kins do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCG_spleasure46;Druchii women aren't exactly known for their modesty, your prudish tendencies have always been derided amongst your peers. How could sex ever help a woman in social climbing anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCH_spleasure46;You've always just wanted to mind your own plots and raids, yet you have Witches and Sorceresses of all kinds walking around half-naked day in day out. How is someone to keep his head clear and plan anything in these conditions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure46;I could try a stronger approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure46;The fire will return, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure46;Maybe I could try something more... unorthodox? Just once?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure46;I... no, no, no, I just can't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure47;You push the young man on the floor, sinking your nails into his skin and twisting his arm. The woman joins you with a whip, trying to catch you off guard, but you take her wrist in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure47;Give it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure47;That's enough for today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure48;You lick the blood off your hands, wrapped around the two young quivering mates. You weren't so sure at the beginning, but now all sorts of nice ideas are coming to your mind for the next sessions, you've been really missing out on something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure48;Maybe I'll pick someone else, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure49;The young man straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure49;The young woman straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure49;Yes! Yes, tell me how I deserve this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure49;That's too much, stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure50;Once the traveller leaves you tied up in the bed, you are exhausted, but at the same time, you still yearn for more. There must be other interesting ways to experience what you did, you could make some research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure50;Yes, very deep research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure51;You are rightfully and justly feared by your servants and vassals alike, as proper Druchii highborn should. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a servants trips you by accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure51;Several at court seem to dislike your harsh methods. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a courtier dares to speak against your final verdict on a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure51;You never really liked violence, much to the ridicule of your Druchii peers. When a farmer you just pardoned ends up in court again for stealing and pleads to you, you start seeing their point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure51;You've always kept true to the Gods and exerted kindness and good judgement in your actions. Yet, sometimes, the stupidity of your servants, the mockery of your courtiers, they really push you to edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure51;You miserable wretch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure51;You know what? He's beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure51;That's it! Now you're getting it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure51;Patience, patience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure52;The courtier cries for forgiveness at every lash, but you still feel like he's not had enough. Exacting the punishment by yourself, without the jailer, makes it feel so much more intimate and satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBspleasure52;I think you've learned your lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure53;You emerge the dungeon soaked in blood and with a heavy breath. The new prisoner is not getting out for some time. The wonders you did to him... It was almost artistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure53;We need to do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure54;You have the farmer flogged on the public square. He almost looked surprised at your verdict, probably he hoped to get free again. Not anymore. And besides, watching the executioner rip the flesh from his back is so gratifying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure54;The maiden deserved that punishment, she was clumsy and irresponsible. It was so gratifying and just to give to her her rightful punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure54;It's your fault! You brought this upon yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure54;I'm so sorry, I don't know what came to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure55;Each wound... Is like a painting celebrating justice, it's almost inebriating. Kindness doesn't mean foolishness after all. One needs to be harsh to be loving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure55;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11142;Having to ride out or even walk after eating so much always makes you nauseous. You had also planned a fencing session today, but perhaps you should take a break...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1142;I'm not feeling like doing anything right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1142;Wouldn't be healthy do nothing after eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11143;You were planning for a walk after the sixth course, but you're feeling too heavy and tired to walk anywhere right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11144;Your whole life is a failure, there is really no point in doing anything if it's always going to be the wrong thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1144;Better do nothing at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1144;I have to try, at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11145;Why even get up of bed when everything and everyone is going to be against you, each day of your accursed life? You might as well lay down and wait for death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11146;Every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor I'm keeping myself into. Despite a few rough mornings, I can barely remember the last time I was sad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1146;Life is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1146;Yeah, but I can barely remember *anything* at all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11147;Another day passes by, spent sitting on my nice soft couch and gorging upon the last delicacies of my cooks. Everything would be fine, if not because I'll have to skip second breakfast tomorrow morning to let the tailor take again my measures for new clothes. Perhaps I can make the servants feed me while he works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1147;He better take them good this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11149;I've lost every appetite. I do nothing, why should I eat anything? I'm not hungry anyway. My body has grown skinnier and sharper as days passed by, even the faintest of the noises and lights bothers me and I find harder to focus for longer times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1149;Am I dreaming right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11154;I know the value of good work and moderation, yet my body is still cursed by past wickedness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1154;I must try to get back into shape, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1154;I've really a lot to worry about already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11155;The rush of appetite I've been having lately has truly been good to me: I feel less tired, everyone at court says I look healthier and my bones do not stick out anymore from under my skin. I do worry about overdoing though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1155;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1155;Maybe it's better to return to more frugal habits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure56;You've discovered new depths of pleasure that most people can only dream of. Why not bestow your knowledge to others as well? You've gained the 'Twist' targeted decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure56;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1200;Your helmet falls off and the enemy's blade strikes true. When you come to your senses again, your whole face has been covered in bandages, covering a ghastly disfigurement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1200;My face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11182;Lately your sour humour has brought you to contemplate your delicate features, the ones bards used to sing about in your halls. Nothing brings you comfort, your life is an unending cycle of suffering... Nothing good ever happens to you, why then you have such a pretty face? As you look at your reflection, you realize you have a blade in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11183;The blade carves deep in your skin, peeling off slices of flesh, taking away your undeserved beauty, painting you of the dark colours of your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11184;In the past few days you thought back to how close you came to disfigure yourself over nothing. The shock has somehow awaken you. Why should you keep living like this any longer? Don't you have suffered enough without beating yourself too? Maybe a more sunny disposition could be what you really need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11185;You weren't even brave enough to rightfully punish yourself for your beauty. Now your untarnished face haunts you in every corner, reminding of your undeserving looks. Today it was once too much and to escape the guilt you ended up jumping off a balcony. Your servants managed to get you healed in time sadly, but you are permanently crippled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1182;I don't deserve this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1182;Is this really what I'm reduced to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1183;The pain is my friend, the pain is good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1184;I shall not fall so low again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1185;I deserve this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCharemsins001;You've decided to take a break and retire with your beloved boytoys in your palace. With plenty of servants, food and drinks, it might be what it takes to find some relief from the pressures of command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins001;Let the fun start!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins002;It was a good time, but you can't ignore your responsibilities forever. With a heavy heart, you finally called off your thralls and ordered the servants to clean up the mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins002;Time to get back to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins003;All these days spent with servants coming at your every word and loving beautiful youngsters whispering sweet things into your ears have really made you understand what a wonderful and special person you are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins003;I'm so beautiful and smart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins004;A drink goes down and another barrel is empty. All this merriment and euphoria are just what you needed to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins004;Pour in some more mead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins005;Having not to worry about battle plans and plots and just try out the last exotic delicacies with your thralls is just what you needed. Eating enough to have your belly filling your lap is an acquired taste in itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins005;Hmmmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins006;You already knew what you were getting into with your vacation, but after some days of unrestrained passion you hardly understand how could you go on without any.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins006;Call in that pretty servant over there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins007;It seems your celebration has had some collateral results. Your pregnancy is starting to show, with all its unpleasant effects, and you've been forced to call off the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins007;That's so unfair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins008;Every day is just another pleasant day of doing nothing. You can hardly think about getting back to your duties anymore. After all, you have servants to deal with those.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins008;Bring me... do... I don't even...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins009;Spending such a great  time with other people doing all sorts of things is really helping to let you appreciate the joys of being with others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins009;We're all having lots of fun here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins010;Why worry about wars, plots and conquest when someone can find joy and love already?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins010;I've already all that I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins011;The last thrall forces another choke of meat down your throat and the cycle begins anew. With their help you've eaten more in these days than you have in your entire life. Yet, no matter how bloated and sweaty you've become, you just can't stop asking for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins011;*omnomnomnomnom*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins012;You don't know what you drank in the last weeks, but you can't really focus as you did any more, and pretty much anything will make you jump off your feet. But you can see so many things that weren't there before, you must take more of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins012;What's THAT!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins013;You almost drowned one of the new servants in wine today. Spending so much time only interacting with close and known faces might be making you a little too suspicious of others...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins013;HE was the suspicious one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins014;Whether it be men or women, food or mead, you want it and aplenty, spending this time off let you understand there's nothing better than enjoying life as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins014;Nothing at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins015;Being away from the problems of rulership for some time has really helped you placate your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins015;Thoughts are so soothing now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins016;You have so many attentions from thralls and servants, all of them listening to you, encouraging you, that you've started to feel a little better about yourself lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins016;Maybe life isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins017;You've spent some time away from your responsibilities as a ruler, but now maybe it's time to go back at it, isn't it? Having to lay motionless for entire days doesn't really help anybody...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins017;It helps ME.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins017;Quick, assemble my council!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins018;You went on as long as you could, day after day, choking on foreign food and intoxicating elixirs, but your body cannot handle it any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins018;Just get me to bed, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins019;A second thrall comes over you, joining the first as he ravages your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins019;More, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins020;Having to wake with an hangover each morning, barely remembering what happened the previous day while being in no condition to live the next, has somehow lost its appeal to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBharemsins020;Enough! Just get me some water and get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins021;You glance nauseous at your bloated belly, trying to move on your side without throwing up. The servants wait around you with plates filled with more food, but right now it might as well be scorpions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins021;I'd rather do something else to waste time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins021;Enough prancing around, there's more important affairs to attend to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins022;Strange to believe it, but all these days doing nothing but feeding your libido seems to have finally satiated it. Right now the mere thought of calling one of your thralls would make you throw up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins022;Give it a few days, it'll come back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins022;Then this whole thing has outlived its usefulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins024;Empty flattery after empty flattery, you're starting to hate all this frivolous attention to your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins024;Less words, more fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCrape.0013;Your thrall stands before you, at the mercy of your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTCrape.0015;Something really special for you, little one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDrape.0015;Hm, thinking again, you bore me. Get lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0016;They always twitch, that can ruin a perfect work. But still, you're satisfied with your new piece. It's a new face altogether, something sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0016;Ever so close to perfection...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCArape.0017;The stables under the moonlight are such a suggestive setup. Your favourite horse is already struggling in his place, smelling the new mate you've brought to him. What a mighty steed. Sometimes you almost feel like joining the fun you're submitting your thrall to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCrape.0020;The eyes of this one was what really caught your attention. They are so beautiful. Especially now that you had them added to your personal painter's last masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCrape.0021;It takes just little one spoonful of powder to create the most hilarious reactions in children. Look at how [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] frets still. It almost makes one wonder what marvellous and terrible things the substance is allowing [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] to see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0021;I'll join the kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBrape.0021;Looking at [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] is way better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0022;After some time, you've run out of things, yet you still think the kid could be made to eat something more. It's almost fascinating, really. And you work has made [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] so plump and soft...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0022;It looks almost... delicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBrape.0022;Let's see if there's something more upstairs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0023;You really cannot understand when they cry. They become part of something beautiful, the sweetest of sensations binding two souls together. Certain to be one of their fondest memories in adulthood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0023;I still remember my first time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0024;The mind of a child is such a pure and delicate thing, to twist it is easy, but bending it to a point is the skill of a master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_asurdebate_12;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has approached you, saying [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will forget what you owe [FromFrom.GetHerHim], where you to change your political stance and align it to [FromFrom.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_asurdebate_12;Hmpf.. I see. Very well then;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_asurdebate_12;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13;Dearest [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWith this missive, I invite you at a great symposium I will be hosting in a few days in my villa. It will be an exquisite reunion, with sublime music and some of the noblest scions of our enlightened kin. It would be grand to count you amongst us.\n\nAwating your confirmation,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13;It would be rude to not join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate13;I don't care for such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13001;An otherwordly music fills the air as the first guests arrive to your private party, followed by servants and courtiers. The beautiful and pristine sights of Ulthuan surround the private villa you've gathered in, enveloping your guests in the bright and delicate artwork of Asur sculptors and carpenters, each detail refined beyond measure through magic and supreme skill.\n It doesn't take long for you to spot [From.GetFirstName], but still, you decide to not approach [From.GetHerHim] immediately, exchanging pleasantries with the other guests and making sure all the servants are fulfilling their tasks appropriately before making your move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13001;Just a few minutes still;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is only after some time that you're formally greeted by your host, who, after a few pleasantries, asks to have a word with you in private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13002;Very well;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate13003;You've finally approached [From.GetFirstName] and, after exchanging a few pleasantries, have managed to take [From.GetHerHim] aside to have some time to speak in private, far from any unwanted listeners.\n It is time for you to make clear your intentions and negotiate whatever deal you have in mind for your special guest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate13003;*Ask for money*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate13004;Slime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14001;How much will you be asking [From.GetFirstName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14001;As much as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate14001;A considerable sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate14001;Just a small token of affection;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate14002;[From.GetFirstName] talks with you for quite a long time and does not shy away from showering you with kind and elaborate words to weave your virtues. Yet, as the discussion goes on, you start to see how [From.GetSheHe] is hinting more and more to something that you might do in exchange of [From.GetHerHis] eternal gratitude.\n It seems to be a matter concerning money. Such a base request, yet weaved by such delicate words... It might even be more agreeable, if the sum hinted at was not so outrageous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To hear your host, it wouldn't even be much for you to be relieved of, to the point you wouldn't even miss what was so graciously given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14002;Of course I shall help you, no need to say anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasurdebate14002;I'm afraid I cannot give what you ask for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14003;In true princely fashion, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to liberally give you the money you needed, without asking anything in return. This public display of opulence has certainly endeared [From.GetHerHim] in the eyes of all the guests, but, more importantly, has allowed you to obtain exactly what you desired, without doing anything in return.\n You can do nothing but profusely thank the gentle guest and continue the evening with the rest of your noble kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate14013;It was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate14004;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to just ask for money to your kin would be disgraceful.

The guest has remembered that [From.GetSheHe] rightfully owes you something for past allowances and is ready to fulfill [From.GetHerHis] charge, provided that, with this gesture, you will consider [From.GetHerHis] standing charge fulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14004;As you prefer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasurdebate14014;[From.GetFirstName] seems to be happy to consider this a meaningful favor on your part and therefore you are happy to readily give [From.GetHerHim] the sum [From.GetSheHe] needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate14014;Be sure to kindly remember this in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14024;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to recognize the weight of the boon you were ready to give [From.GetHerHim]. You have therefore no other choice but to withdraw your request entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate14005;So be it, I'll marry you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasurdebate14015;Outstanding such a crass matter resolved in such a sublime way: before all the guests, you and [From.GetFirstName] declare your love for each other.

EVTOPTAasurdebate14006;How rude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate14016;Unfortunately you had to be direct to convince [From.GetFirstName] of your refusal. This impoliteness to your host will certainly affect your reputation, but you are firmly sure it is the lesser evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate16001;Good, Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16011;The points made by [From.GetFirstName] were certainly valid. Denouncing publicly your spouse might have gained you some bad reputation, but you're certain it will all soon passed as other realize the righteousness of your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasurdebate16021;What a disgrace. Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to publicly denounce and forsake you as a spouse. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] was wayed by the poisonous words coming from the slithering tongue of [FromFrom.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBasurdebate18002;Time and again, you defend against the preposterous accuses of your opponent, shaming [From.GetHerHis] conduct as a host and counterattacking with some insinuations of your own.\n Time and again, your opponent starts anew, skillfully defending against your quips. The discussion goes on for hours, as the public continues to enjoy the music and the wine, with its ears always focused on you.\n Then, finally, brought to exasperation by [From.GetFirstName]'s claims, you cannot refrain from directly swearing at [From.GetHerHim]. As [From.GetSheHe] smirks with satisfaction, you both realize [From.GetSheHe] has won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate18002;Hmpfh, you worthless..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate19;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been spending a lot of time celebrating you and your dynasty. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has talked to friends and acquaintaces about your great deeds and complimented your virtues with you in person.\n As [From.GetSheHe] goes on, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't shy away from trying to force out of you your opinion on some political issue [From.GetSheHe] seems to care very much about. At this point it would be incredibly rude to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19;And I will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate19;But still I must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate19001;[From.GetFirstName] could do nothing besides granting [From.GetHerHis] support after all you've said and done to stroke [From.GetHerHis] ego. It might have been somewhat debasing to spend so much time singing praises of someone else, but it served its purpose in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19001;It is an exercise in dialectic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate19002;[From.GetFirstName] did not seem to get the tone of your music. Such a waste of time and reputation will come to nothing. You've spent days praising [From.GetHerHim] amongst friends and acquaintances, yet [From.GetSheHe] still refuses to return your kindness with a hand of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19002;It is an exercise in dialectic at the very least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur54;Magnificent [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI write you to humbly request on behalf of [From.GetFirstName] that you may accept [From.GetHerHim] to your court. I can attest that [From.GetSheHe] is a young but very promising intellect and that [From.GetSheHe] could only enrich your already illustrious court.\n\nEagerly awaiting for an answer,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur54;I'll allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur54;I don't need more courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur54001;Noble [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nYou have convinced me to give [FromFrom.GetFirstName] a chance at showing these supposed qualities you claim [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has. You can tell [FromFrom.GetHerHim] that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] the Phoenix Court awaits [FromFrom.GetHerHis] arrival and will be ready to embrace its new member.\n\nAs dictated by\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur54001;Perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur54002;Noble [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI'm afraid the inner court of Ulthuan is already filled with young and promising minds to the limits of its capacity. Perhaps I shall have need of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s qualities in the future, but not this century, I'm afraid.\n\nAs dictated by\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur54002;Damnations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce1;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to divorce you. As the offended party, you can choose to demand compensation in the form of gold or land, if [From.GetSheHe] has any. If [From.GetFirstName] has not enough silver to pay you for, [From.GetFirstName] will receive a serious hit to [From.GetHerHis] reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce1;I don't really care, [From.GetSheHe] can go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce1;I'll demand monetary compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsdivorce1;I'll demand land from [From.GetHerHis] demesne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce2;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to allow the divorce proceedings to be completed without asking anything more than your part of the costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce2;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset by your decision to divorce. If you wish for [From.GetHerHis] cohoperation, [From.GetSheHe] has set up a punitive compensation for [From.GetHerHis] broken feelings and loss of status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce3;I don't have that kind of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3001;[From.GetFirstName] has capitulated to your request. After everything has been signed, you're ready to say goodbye to [From.GetHerHim] forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3001;And good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3002;[From.GetFirstName] has refused to give in to your demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3002;Just go away then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce3002;Then guess what? No divorce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3003;[From.GetFirstName] did not take well at all your refuse and has decided to retort annulling completely the divorce proceedings. It seems you'll still be married for some time after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3003;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce4;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset by your decision to divorce. If you wish for [From.GetHerHis] cohoperation, [From.GetSheHe] has asked for you to give up to some of your demesne as a reparation for the damage caused by your hearthless soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce4;As long as [From.GetSheHe] goes away;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce4;I won't do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur55;[From.GetFirstName] has been talking with you for some time on how, were worst came to worst, [From.GetSheHe] would not want [From.GetHerHis] fortunes to go to anyone else but you, considering [From.GetSheHe] has no children of [From.GetHerHis] own to pass them on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur55;I graciously accept your gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur55;No reason to lose hope, we might still have kids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur55001;You've talked to [From.GetFirstName] for some time on how, telling [From.GetHerHim] of how, were worst came to worst, you wouldn't want your fortunes to go to anyone else but [From.GetHerHim], considering you've had no children of your own to pass them on. You've finally reached an agreement in that regard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur55001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur55002;You've talked to [From.GetFirstName] for some time on how, telling [From.GetHerHim] of how, were worst came to worst, you wouldn't want your fortunes to go to anyone else but [From.GetHerHim], considering you've had no children of your own to pass them on. Sadly, [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to want such a responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur55002;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage1001;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage1001;It seems [From.GetFirstName] has married another elf. Any other attempt at courship can certainly no longer taken in broad daylight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZselfmarriage1001;This was a waste of time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1001;I'l just ask [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1001;A generous show of wealth will prove my commitment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1001;A generous show of power will prove my commitment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1001;There must be some other way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage1003;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with passion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1003;There must be some other way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage1005;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1005;I shall hunt rare games for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1005;I shall gift [From.GetHerHim] the most precious items of my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1005;I will show [From.GetHerHim] exquisite pleasures such as [From.GetSheHe] has never seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1005;I shall give [From.GetHerHim] access to my vast library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2;[From.GetFirstName] has spent the past months drowning you in presents and gifts of all sorts, hoping to receive attention from you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2;I do like presents;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage2;What a waste of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2001;You spent a lot on [From.GetFirstName] but it certainly seems [From.GetSheHe] appreciated many of your gifts. Showing to be a dependable partner is certainly fundamental to put the basis of a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2001;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2002;Despite your efforts and expenses [From.GetFirstName] has not looked interested in any way to any of the presents you've riddled [From.GetHerHis] home in the past weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2002;Hmpf;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3;[From.GetFirstName] has tried many times in the past weeks to show off [From.GetHerHis] influence and power. You've had many acquaintances talk of [From.GetHerHim] in a throughly positive light and telling you what a wonderful spouse [From.GetSheHe]'d make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3;That is true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage3;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3001;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] has worked flawlessly: you had to call in several favors and subtly have your friends work their ways into [From.GetHerHis] circle of acquaintances to tell [From.GetHerHim] what a wonderful partner you'd make, but it was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3001;Yes, it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3002;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] seems to have fallen flat: despite all the favors you had to call in from friends and relatives, nobody was able to convince [From.GetHerHim] of your good intentions and noble birth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3002;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another poem. You've lost count by now of how many sweet words [From.GetSheHe] has written for you in delicate and moving style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4;That is sweet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage4;How tedious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4001;You've spent weeks writing rhymes to [From.GetFirstName], and [From.GetSheHe] finally has started to mellow down on you. It was a lot of work, but you seem to have caught [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4002;All the sleepless nights spend writing poems to the sweet [From.GetFirstName] appear to have been for naught: [From.GetSheHe] remains cold to your delicate verses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4002;Hm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5;From shows of light and illusions to work of art impossible to create for the most skilled craftsman, [From.GetFirstName] has given you quite a show of [From.GetHerHis] magical powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5;I'm impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage5;That's somewhat irresponsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5001;[From.GetFirstName] has certainly been impressed by the spells and incantations you worked on for [From.GetHerHim], weaving wind after wind to catch [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5002;Not even the Winds of Magic seem to catch [From.GetFirstName]'s attention. Your many attempts at impress [From.GetHerHim] with your magic have come to nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5002;How can one not appreciate the Art!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6;[From.GetFirstName] has been cornering you at every occasion, whispering sweet nothings in your ear and leading you in the most compromising places. You've resisted [From.GetHerHis] advances until now, but is it really worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6;Let's do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage6;Maybe later on;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6001;[From.GetFirstName] couldn't have resisted for much longer. You've used all your skills in the past weeks to charm and seduce [From.GetHerHim] and your effort has finally given its fruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6001;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6002;You've used all the tricks you had, but [From.GetFirstName] appears immune to your charms. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe]'s not really interested in the physical aspect of the future relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6002;What else then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another exotic fur, fashioned after [From.GetHerHis] last kill. This suitor has spent the last week overflowing your home with trophies of [From.GetHerHis] hunts, all made in your honor, according to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7;It's beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage7;So many wasted lives;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7001;[From.GetFirstName] has been captivated by the trophies you've sent [From.GetHerHim] in the past days, result of your hard work in the wilderness. In fact, you've heard from multiple sources of [From.GetHerHim] wearing some of your furs in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7002;[From.GetFirstName] has not even pretended to accept your last trophy, sending the fur back with a polite request to stop your endeavours in the wilderness. It seems like this is not something [From.GetSheHe]'s interested in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7002;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8;Another ravishing bouquet has been sent by [From.GetFirstName]. There have been several in the past days, accompanied by invitations to [From.GetHerHis] villa as well. You're wondering if it would be proper to accept at this point;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8;It does look enchanted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage8;I have no time for this frivolousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8001;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted your invitation to visit your gardens at the villa. You guide [From.GetHerHim] across the colorful landscape and soon captivate [From.GetHerHim] with the wonders you've grown within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8002;[From.GetFirstName] continues to ignore your floreal presents and the invitations to the villa. According to [From.GetHerHim] it is not a good period, but it might be that [From.GetSheHe] just doesn't like your flowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8002;I should try something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9;More than once in the past weeks [From.GetFirstName] has managed to drag you into some obscene, wild party which has left you sickly and confused at every morning. At first it looked unbearable, but now you've starting to see how this kind of entertainment could be something of an acquired taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9;See you again tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage9;Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9001;You've managed to sneak [From.GetFirstName] into more than one wild party in the last few weeks. At first [From.GetSheHe] didn't seem to appreciate your companionship, but [From.GetSheHe] has since then started to like celebrating excess alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9001;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9002;You've attempted to sway [From.GetFirstName] with wild feasts and intoxicating philters, but [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem interested in your kind of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9002;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10;[From.GetFirstName] is certainly meek for a suitor, if [From.GetSheHe] is a suitor at all. In the past week, [From.GetSheHe] has only been interested in spending time reading with you and talking about the ancient legends of your race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10;It is all so interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage10;What a bore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10001;You've spent days with [From.GetFirstName], nosedived in old tomes and ancient scrolls, studying the history of your great heritage. There is so much you seem to have in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10001;Did you read this one yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10002;Your attempts at showing some ancient elven scrolls to [From.GetFirstName] have failed, no differently from many other similar gifts. It might be [From.GetSheHe] isn't very interested in ancient elven literature;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10002;How can that be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage11112;Before you make your proposal official, you should decide what kind of union are you hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11112;A Regular Marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage11112;A Matrilineal Marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a matrilineal union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of matrilineal marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a regular union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of regular marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11;Before answering, I must consult my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage11;I could never disobey my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11001;[From.GetFirstName] was ready to accept your proposal. Not that there was ever any doubt about it: a courtier can hardly oppose the decision of [From.GetHerHis] rightful liege. A great ceremony will soon be held and the priestesses shall bind you in marriage, formalizing your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this matrilineal marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in matrilineal marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this regular marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in regular marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage12;I accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12;I cannot allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12001;You are heartened to hear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s answer to your proposal. A great ceremony will soon held to bind you and your newfound soulmate in marriage and formalize your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12001;I'm so happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12002;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] doesn't seem to share your feelings for [From.GetHerHim] and has refused your proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12002;How could you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13;Many elves come to partecipate at your wedding ceremony, congratulating both with you and your spouse, discussing politics and listening to the soave music in the air. The priests of many gods have come to celebrate your union, bestowing bestowing blessings of fertility from Isha on the bride, auguries of fortune from Lileath, advices of steady conduct to please Asuryan, promises of riches from Vaul and predictions of long life from Morai-heg. Offerings are brought to each of the shrines as you walk by them and receive the gods' blessings, binding you each time further together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13;And so we shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13001;The promise of life can only be bought by the certainty of death.\n You and your spouse raise the beating heart of the sacrifice to the shrine of Khaine and let it burn under the unforgiving gaze of the Lord of Murder, in the hopes it'll placate his thirst and allow your union to bear fruit. Only a few selected guests are honored with an invitation, dutifully kept afar and secretly watched by crossbowmen, ready to act at the first suspicious movement. Once the first ceremony is finally over, you leave the temple with your spouse, ready to make an ever more gruesome and enticing ritual to satisfy Atharti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13001;The gods watch us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13002;There is a time for everything. As you reach the spring of this cycle, you are united with your spouse, but, as all Asrai know, this time will someday pass and you shall be separated. In your marriage, you embody, in a small part, the sacred union of Isha and Kurnous and, like them and like all things, your happiness now will find balance in future sorrow. This is what the forest spirit remembers you as it gives its blessing and binds you together. Yet, as all cycles pass, you shall accept the nature of things with a light heart and do the best of what you have right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13002;We will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage1001;Since you're married already, it would not be appropriate to continue courting [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTXselfmarriage1001;It was fun while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
