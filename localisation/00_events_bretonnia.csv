#namespace = BRETONNIA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.0;You are the ruler of a Bretonnian castle, and you - like the rest of your fellow rulers - are an ordained Knight of the Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.1;You are a skilled warrior, and it is time you took up your duties to the realm and became a Knight Errant of Bretonnia. It is your duty to seek out dangerous threats and conquer them in the name of the Lady.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.10.b;No, a mere mob of orcs is an unworthy foe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.10;You hear rumours that an orc warband is raiding this area. Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.11.a;I hope there's enough for all of us! Onward to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.11.b; No, wait. I think I see a giant over there, this way men!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.11;After some hard riding you find the trail of destruction left behind and quickly catch up to the orcs. The greenskins seem to be meandering across the countryside, looting and burning at random according to the whims of a larger-looking boss. It's only a small war party of less than two-score orcs with a mob of lesser attendant greenskins, but your band of faithful are but a handful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.12.a;For the Lady! Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.12;The orcs are too unprepared to do more than turn and roar defiance as your band approaches, and you smash into them with your fellow knights in a glorious charge. With lance and sword you drive a deep wedge into their hastily formed ranks. The orcs fight poorly and the boss only slightly more challenging, your lance taking it in the throat before you crush it into the mud. The assorted goblins and snotlings that were following the mob attempt to scatter, with most of them ridden down with ease. It is a righteous slaughter, and their kind will now know the folly of trespassing in these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.13.a;Men, advance backwards! Double quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.13;As soon as you begin to charge the orcs, the boss in control of the mob spots you, shouting and beating his underlings into crude ranks to take the impact. Some of them brace with great shields and pikes, and as your charge is broken you find yourself being attacked from all directions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.14;As you travel along the coast you spot a sleek black ship moored in the shallow water. On the beach nearby is a dark elf raiding party, and they have captured a number of humans! Surely taken in lightning-quick raids on nearby farms and villages, they are preparing them for transport back to their terrible slave-markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.15;Your mighty charge takes the foul slavers completely by surprise, and rather than form a line and try to repel you, they make a mad dash for their ships. You slay many of the cowardly elves, and free the captives. The surviving raiders make it back to their vessel and flee, but after taking such losses and failing to carry cargo they are unlikely to return any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.16.a;Arghh, men *cough* advance... backwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.16.b;A true knight never turns from danger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.16;The dark elves have sharp eyes that saw you coming from afar, and quickly form disciplined ranks with tall shields and cruel-looking blades at the ready. Worse still, as you approach the taste of foul magic suffuses the air. An unnaturally pale, lithe sorceress pushes her way to the front of the line, leering at you while performing an arcane ritual, and suddenly the air around you explodes with thunder! When you come to a moment later you realise you've been thrown from your horse and are smoking slightly!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.17.a;Forwards! To victory! For the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.17;A surge of righteous anger fills you and you leap back up on your horse, spit the blood from your mouth, couch your lance, and with a great battle cry you charge the foul sorceress and her cohorts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.18;The Sorceress casts another spell at you, but as her lightning bolt fails to stop you, she turns and runs and the rest follow. You slaughter many of them as they flee for their ship, and free the captives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.19;You rush the dark elves, but the sorceress merely grins wickedly and hurls another spell at you. Lightning arcs out from her hands once more and strikes you, and you feel excruciating pain as you are once again blasted from your horse. This battle is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.2;You are a knight of Bretonnia, it is only fitting that you travel the land doing great deeds, rescuing maidens and slaying monsters. Will you take up the questing life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.20.a;I return home to heal - For the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.20;You have become wounded, and can no longer carry on the questing life. It is time to return to your castle and regain your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.21;You are a knight of Bretonnia, but only the most noble and pure knights are worthy to sip from the Holy Grail of the Lady of the Lake. Do you want to test yourself on this great - but also dangerous, quest?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.22.b;Simple peasants - so that's where my tax money went!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.22;You come across a remote shrine, dedicated to a sighting of the Lady many years ago. Naturally you leave an offering to help maintain the shrine, but as you prepare to leave a local headman boldly asks you for a further donation to the help feed the local village.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.23.b;I'm all alone, no one will know if I just ride away...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.23;You know you are not the bravest of knights, but you do try your best. On a solitary ride through the countryside you come across one of your men-at-arms, his weapon sundered, his shield split and his chest carved open. He manages to gasp out an account between fits of coughing, and before he passes you eventually discern that a Norscan berserker had wandered out of the wilderness, raving and cursing in a crude language and slaughtering anyone he sees. He has already slain twenty good men single-handedly, and judging by the screams just over the hill, he's not far off...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.24.a;Away with that, temptress! Just water for me from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.24.b;I could indulge myself just once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.24;You are not the purest or most abstinent of knights, so life is a daily challenge to meet the lofty ideals you hold. One night you and your retinue arrive in a decent tavern to rest after your latest efforts, and soon after you take a seat a barmaid arrives to serve. Tired and deprived, you feel especially appreciative at the sight of the pitcher of wine balanced on her hip, and her warm inviting smile...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.25.a;*restrain yourself* Be on your way, peasant...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.25.b;I'll horsewhip you from here to Cathay, you foul peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.25;While passing through the countryside, you proceed past a filthy family of mud-scrabbling peasants. They drop their loads and fall to the ground with eyes averted as you pass by, but you can hardly believe it when one particularly malodorous one looks you directly in the eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.26.a;Well met, Sir Knight! I am ready for the challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.26;You can't believe it... one day while riding in the woods, the Green Knight appears. This is the final test! If you prove worthy and defeat him, the Lady of the Lake will appear and allow you to sip from the Holy Grail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.27;It... it's finally happening! The Lady of the Lake appears before you, her grace and beauty beyond compare. Purified from your trials she allows you to sip from the Grail, and you feel vitality and strength flow into you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.3;You have become maimed, and can no longer carry on the questing life. It is time to return to your castle, and focus on strengthening your own lands with the rest of your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.30.c;I care nothing for what my vassals think!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.31.a;Yes, I rule with the Lady's Blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia31B;No, but I will continue questing for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.31.c;I care nothing for what my vassals think!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.31;Seven years have passed - have you become a Grail Knight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.32;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has succeeded in the Grail Quest, and now rules with the blessing of the Lady of the Lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.33;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has failed in his Grail Quest, but has decided to rule on without the blessing of the Lady of the Lake. This is almost certain to start a civil war in that realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.34;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia is having difficulty completing his grail quest, but is still determined to quest on until he succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.4;You have quested for a long time now, perhaps it is time to return home and see to your responsibilities there?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.6.b;No, I seek greater glories than mere trolls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.6;While searching for local challenges, you come across an unusual story. Sheep and peasants have gone missing, and despite repeated punishments the shepherds insist they are not lacking in their duties. They claim a foul beast, as tall as a house and reeking like a tannery lurks in the hills, periodically emerging to devour whatever it can catch. After some conference with your retainers you determine it could very well be a troll! Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.7.b;No, wait... what if there is a dragon over there instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.7;After a week of searching, you finally come upon some troll tracks which lead to a dark cave which emanates horrendous smells and sounds. It seems there are more than one after all. Girding yourself as best as you are able, you light some torches and prepare to destroy this threat to the local community.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.8.a;I dedicate this victory to the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.8;Your band marches into the troll lair, and though they are strong and ferocious opponents they are no match for your superior knightly valour. Swords cut them to pieces, torches and oil cauterise their wounds, and faith wreathes you like an unbreakable barrier. After slaying half a dozen of them, you take a moment to rest and examine the lair. Though trolls are usually far too stupid to gather treasure and are more likely to simply eat it, for whatever reason these ones had a small pile of loot. Perhaps it was dessert?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.9.a;Men, advance in the other direction - quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.9;Your band marches into the troll lair, full of pride and zeal, but quickly find yourselves in trouble! Six trolls loom out of the darkness like living nightmares, snatching your retainers up into their maws and ignoring the few wounds you manage to inflict. You are hard pressed to make it back to the exit alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35desc;It... it's finally happening! The Lady of the Lake appears before you, her grace and beauty beyond compare. She let's you sip from the grail, but it is not the invigorating and life changing experience you had heard it would be. But, surely you feel... something?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35A;I... I think I feel a little more holy now?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35B;It was the true holy grail, it must have been!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35C;No, this isn't right. I must continue questing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia36desc;There have been some doubts cast on your vision of the Lady and the Holy Grail. You do not have the aura that other grail knights have, nor did the Green Knight appear to challenge you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia36A;They weren't there - it happened! Maybe the Grail is simply different for each man?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia37desc;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has supposedly completed his grail quest, but there are doubts as to whether or not it was the real Grail. This will make his rule a troubled one, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
DR_bretonnia_son_dies_battle_knight_errant;Several former Knight Errants have recently returned home after completing their questing duties, and they bring news most grave. Your child, [From.GetTitledFirstName], was killed by a group of beastmen during an extremely dangerous mission in southern Bretonnia. They assure you that [From.GetSheHe] faced the foul beasts with bravery and tried [From.GetHerHis] best before [From.GetSheHe] was killed by their overwhelming number.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_dies_battle_knight_errant_opt;My son... he died a hero...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_ambitious_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from his quest as Knight Errant as a changed being. [From.GetSheHe] is more ambitious and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent as a Knight Errant did [From.GetHerHim] good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_ambitious_knight_errant_opt;Did you bring any riches home with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_drunk_knight_errant;After many years in service, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally finshed his duties as a as Knight Errant and returned home. Your child is a changed being, however. [From.GetSheHe] now spends whole afternoons drinking, and stinks of ale, no longer listening to your fatherly advices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_drunk_knight_errant_opt;I knew something bad was going to happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_better_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally returned home after a long and successful journey as Knight Errant! [From.GetSheHe] learned much from his battles against the enemies of the Lady and Bretonnia, alongside fellow knights!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_better_knight_errant_opt;Tell me about your missions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_drunkard_knight_errant;After many years in service, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally left the Fighter's Guild and returned home. Your child is a changed being, however. [From.GetSheHe] stinks of .;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_drunkard_knight_errant_opt;I knew something bad was going to happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_depressed_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from his duties as a Knight Errant, but [From.GetSheHe] refuses to speak of [From.GetHerHis] experiences during them. You know [From.GetSheHe] took part in several battles and killed uncountable bandits, beastmen and orcs, but instead of reveling in the glory of [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments, [From.GetFirstName] is plagued by nightmares and jumps at sudden sounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_depressed_knight_errant_opt;Strange...;Étrange...;Seltsam...;;Extraño...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_experienced_knight_errant;A mysterious knight clad in strange armour approaches your throne, and before [From.GetSheHe] can be contained, the strange warrior relieves your guard of [From.GetHerHis] spear in a swift, fluid motion and tosses it aside. Other guards hurry forward, but you raise your hand to stop them. The stranger is [From.GetTitledFirstName], at last returned from his duties as Knight Errant!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_experienced_knight_errant_opt;[From.GetFirstName]! You've... changed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_lowborn_wife_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come back from his duties as Knight Errant, but [From.GetSheHe] is not alone. [From.GetSheHe] has saved a nobleborn lady during his quests and brought her with him. Though of a lesser noble bloodline, this woman seems to be of a perfect breed, a nice addition to our lineage!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_lowborn_wife_knight_errant_opt;To each [From.GetHerHis] own;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_with_gold_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from his Errantry Tour with a carriage filled with the spoils of [From.GetHerHis] quests! Apparently being a Knight Errant is very profitable business. Your child insists on sharing these riches with you, [From.GetHerHis] loving father.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_with_gold_knight_errant_opt;[From.GetFirstName], you make me proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_wounded_knight_errant;A frail, robed character is led into your throne room, and your guards explain that [From.GetSheHe] just arrived on a carriage. The character would only speak your name over and over again, and so [From.GetSheHe] was brought to you. To your horror, you recognize [From.GetHerHim] at last as [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_wounded_knight_errant_opt;My son, what has happened to you!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_return_knight_errant;Upon learning of the death of your father, you left your Errantry Tour and departed for home on a carriage filled with gold from your glorious accomplishments. It was a long and perilous journey back, but your feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is your birthright. The throne is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_return_knight_errant_opt;It's a sad moment. But it's good to finally be back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_wants_knight_errant;Your child, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has decided to set out on an Errantry Tour in order to prove [From.GetHerHis] his honour as a true Bretonnian! Although [From.GetSheHe] will no doubt gain both glory and valuable battle experience as a Knight Errant, there will be many dangerous quests that could well cost [From.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_wants_knight_errant_accept;Go forth, son, for the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_wants_knight_errant_deny;I will not allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_become_knight_siege;The camp was attacked last night. It seems the besieged are growing desperate with their tactics. Most of the men were caught by surprise but not you... you were not only ready to fight, but rallied some men around you and excelled during in combat.

La mayoría de los hombres fueron cogidos por sorpresa, pero no tú... No sólo estabas presto a luchar, formaste con algunos hombres a tu alrededor y sobresaliste durante la batalla. ¡Uno de los caballeros se ofreció a ungirte en el acto!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_become_knight_battle;The enemy is flanking! You rallied some men around you and organized a great counter-charge, breaking the flanking enemies. A deed worthy of a Knight of the Realm!;L'ennemi a tenté de vous prendre par les flancs. Vous avez rallié de nombreux hommes et avez excellé durant les combats. Un chevalier offre de vous oindre sur le champ !;;;¡Nos flanquean! Tras reunir a algunos hombres a tu alrededor y destacar durante los combates, uno de los caballeros se ofrece a ungirte en el acto!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DR_bretonnia_tournament1012A;Time to fight fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_tournament1100;[From.GetTitledFirstName] dodged your strike and rushed in from the side. [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to strike you with a swift and powerful blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCtourney.27;The hapless [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] has no chance as [From.GetSheHe] is sent flying by your ruthless strike of the lance.

EVTDESCtourney.40;You have been drawn against [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] in the next joust, and [From.GetSheHe] is desperate to win it seems.

EVTDESCtourney.41;When [From.GetSheHe] heard of your bribe, [From.GetTitledFirstName] feigned disgust and reluctance at first, but this was clearly a face saving act.

EVTDESCtourney.43;[From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s aim is poor, but you casually shift your body in the way so you catch a mild blow from it.

EVTDESCtourney.45;Whilst perparing for the tourney a young peasant boy has taken to helping with your horse and armour.

Perhaps he would make a good squire?;Alors que vous vous prépariez pour le tournoi, un jeune paysan vous a proposé de vous aider avec votre armure et votre monture.
