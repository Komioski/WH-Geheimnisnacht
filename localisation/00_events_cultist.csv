EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_1;With the help of other acolytes and children of the Plaguefather, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Nurgle in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be feeling the Plaguelord's love even now. It is inevitable that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] will join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_1A;I'll bide my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_1A;it seems [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is not quite ready for the gifts of Grandfather Nurgle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_1B;Let us give [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] one of Nurgle's gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_1B;This will help [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] see the joy one can receive from the Lord of Decay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_1C;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the glory of Father Nurgle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_2;Over the past few days you have been hearing voices and having strange dreams of plague victims cavorting in piles of filth, even as their flesh rots away. At first you questioned your own sanity, but this morning you awoke to find you had contracted a horrible disease!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_2A;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_3;Over the past few days you have been hearing voices and having strange dreams of plague victims cavorting in piles of filth, even as their flesh rots away. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_3A;No, never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_3A; As awful as this is, nothing good could happen by going to the sewers alone at night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_3B;Fine! Anything to stop these nightmares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_4;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in the sewers, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to embrace Nurgle. However, all come before the Maggot Lord eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_4A;All glory to Father Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_5;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in the sewers, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is covered in filth and looks half-mad, but they shall soon find solace in the arms of the Plaguefather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_5A;Come now, dear friend, Papa Nurgle will make things right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_6;You follow the directions to the letter and go alone into some sewer, deep underground. You soon find yourself surrounded by hooded figures in filthy, decaying robes. The plague-ridden figures begin to chant words of power that you cannot resist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_6A;Nurgle! Plaguefather! Lord of Decay! I shall serve you, just end my pain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_7;With the help of other acolytes and devotees of She Who Thirsts, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Slaanesh in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be experiencing the ecstasy of the Master of Excess even now. This pleasure will surely cause [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_7A;Let us invite [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to a party where we can show them the joys of the Prince of Pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_7B;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the sensation of the Lord of Delights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_8;You have been invited to a feast, but you soon notice that this is no ordinary party. You see some of the other guests begin to overindulge in food and wine while others start performing lewd and licentious acts to themselves and others...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_8A;Time to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_8B;This is great, I'm staying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_9;You invited [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to a party where you made sure that the mood would turn to more extreme activities. However, it turns out that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] left early and didn't partake in the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_9A;[Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHisCap] loss. I'll keep trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_10;You invited [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to a party where you made sure that the mood would turn to more carnal activities. Luckily [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] enjoyed [Root.PlotTarget.GetHimselfHerself], and will soon follow the ways of the Lord of Dark Delights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_10A;The Master of Ecstasy will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_11;Lately you have been haunted by unbearably pleasurable dreams where you engage in unspeakable acts with impossibly beautiful creatures with the features of both men and women. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_11A;No, never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_11A;Going to a brothel alone at night will only make things worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_11B;Maybe there's something to this message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_11B;I could perhaps get some 'relief' at the brothel as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_12;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated brothel, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to embrace Slaanesh. However, no one can resist the Prince of Pleasure forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_12A;Soon all will serve Slaanesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_13;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated brothel, and now [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you. You can see [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] desire for more sensation in [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] eyes as you begin to instruct [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] in the ways of the Lord of Dark Delights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_13A;We welcome you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_14;You follow the instructions to the letter and go alone to a remote brothel. There you see people engaging in all manner of unspeakable acts. As they moan and cry out dark words power, you find yourself unable to resist the temptation the words bring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_14A;Slaanesh! Prince of Chaos! Lord of Excess! I shall follow you into a world of endless sensations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_15;With the help of other acolytes and followers of the Changer of Ways, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Tzeentch in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be filled with the ambition of the Architect of Fate even now. [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] cannot escape change and will join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_15A;Let us send [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] this book describing the true state of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_15B;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the splendour of the Master of Deceit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_16;A book without a title was pushed into my hands by a hooded man clad in midnight blue. Something was said, but was lost in the confusion. The book was still there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_16A;Hey... wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_16B;It wants me to read it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_16C;Burn it! It is clearly a heretical text.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_17;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] has the book in his possession, and your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has spent a great deal of time lately trying to decipher its secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_17A;Excellent! Soon, he will be ready to accept the ways of the Great Mutator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_18;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] had the book in his possession, but your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has burned it without opening it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_18A;Only a fool would try escape the schemes of the Great Conspirator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_19;Lately you have been haunted by maniacal dreams filled with riotous colours and creature beyond imagining, while your waking moments are filled with runaway daydreams and intricate plans. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you achieve your goals. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_19A;No, never! Nothing comes for free, there is always catch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_19B;If this person at the inn can help me, I would be stupid not to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_20;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated inn, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to embrace Tzeentch. However, none can escape the Changer of Ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_20A;Soon all will serve Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_21;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated inn, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you. You speak to him of Tzeentch and the power that awaits, and soon enough, [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] gives in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_21A;We welcome you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_22;You follow the instructions to the letter and go alone to a remote inn. There you find a group of hooded people, each wearing a different sinister mask. They begin whispering fell words of power and you know you need only take their potency for your own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_22A;Tzeentch! Father of Lies! the Great Mutator! I shall devote myself to your ever-changing ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_23;With the help of other acolytes and fanatics of the Blood God, you have succeeded in placing several artifacts of Khorne in the chambers of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHeCap] should be filled with the rage of Brass Lord even now. This blood-lust will no doubt cause [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] to join us soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_23A;Let us send [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] this weapon dedicated to the Lord of the Skull Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_23B;The time has come to show [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] the glory of Khorne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_24;A package arrived for you today that contained a masterfully crafted weapon. However, no matter how many times you clean it, you can't seem to remove the bloodstains the blade...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_24A;Bloodstains never injured anyone, it's the injury that makes the bloodstain. Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_24B;This is an ill omen. I don't care how fine a weapon it is, destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_25;You delivered the weapon to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName], and your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has grown quite fond of it, using it upon any who displease [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_25A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_26;You delivered the weapon to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName], however your agents inform you that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] destroyed soon after. HOW DARE THEY DENY KHORNE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_26;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_27;Lately you have been haunted by dreams of endless slaughter. In them you crush your enemies and see them driven before you. You awake as you hear the lamentations of their women. However, today you received an anonymous message: 'We can help you. Follow these directions and come alone...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_27A;No, never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_27A;What good could come of going to fighting pit alone at night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_27B;Sounds Fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_CULTISTPLOT_27B;Maybe I can even bash some heads too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_28;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated fighting pit, but [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] never showed up. Perhaps [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] is not yet ready to shed blood for Khorne. However, all will shed blood for the Blood God before long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_28A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_29;You sent [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous message to meet you alone in an isolated fighting pit, and [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] stands before you.

EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_29A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_30;You follow the instructions to the letter and go alone to a remote fighting pit. There a person cloaked in red tells you to take your fill killing the captives you see around you. Their screams are the sweetest sound you ever heard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_30A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_31;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to bring the gifts of the Plaguefather to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s homelands. Grandfather Nurgle will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_31A;All should share in the gifts of the Plague Lord;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_32;An outbreak of a strange and virulent disease has occurred in one of your provinces. The unnatural spread of it suggests this is the work of cultists devoted to the Ruinous Powers! All you can do now is try to contain the outbreak and redouble your efforts to root out cultists in your midst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_32A;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] save us from these plagues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_33;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to incite a tribe of feral beastmen to ravage [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s homelands. Khorne will be pleased by the strife this causes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_33A;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_34;Your marshal informs you that a tribe of beastmen has suddenly arrived and started attacking your holdings, raiding villages and burning homesteads. The sudden nature of this suggests that they were guided there by cultists devoted to the Ruinous Powers! Worse still, the peasants are blaming you for the lack of protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_34A;From the fury of the beastmen, [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], deliver us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_35;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to taint the food and water supplies in [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s land with Warpdust, which will lead to an increase in horrific mutations. Tzeentch will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_35A;Glory to the Great Mutator!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_36;Your steward tells you that traces of Warpdust have been found to be poisoning your land. Evidence suggests this is the work of cultists devoted to the Ruinous Powers! We will likely see an increased number of mutations, perhaps even in your own court, until the Warpdust dissipates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_36A;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] protect us from the gaze of the Dark Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_37;With the help of various backers - both witting and unwitting - you are now in a position to subvert [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s lands with carefully prepared intoxicants and public agitators. Slaanesh will be pleased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_37A;Glory to the Prince of Pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CULTISTPLOT_38;Your steward informs you that a sudden rash of riots, bizarre festivals and even spontaneous public orgies have struck a particular region. The peasants seem to drink, whore, and gamble away all their income, and even some of the better bred citizens do the same. It is suspected that it is no mere passing craze, but a deliberate attempt by servants of the Dark Gods to weaken your rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CULTISTPLOT_38A;But... they'll still pay taxes, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cult_of_pleasure_desc;The Cult of Pleasure is an ancient cabal dedicated to Atharti, the Lady of Pleasure, stemming from just after the High Elves first won their wars against Chaos. Centered on Morathi, it was destroyed in the wars of the Sundering, but from time to time, especially during times of peace and ease, certain Elves of less than stellar character are drawn to recreate it. Its adherents care only for their own pleasures, living indolent lives of splendor and decadence. Both Malekith and the Phoenix King hunt and crack down on these cultists as soon as they’re found.;Ceux qui servent le Grand Adversaire se cachent au milieu de nous, consacrant leurs dépravations et perfidies à leur Seigneur Satan. Chaque transgression est un hymne, chaque assassinat un rugissement de défi contre la parole [Root.GetHighGodDuDelaDes]. Lucifer récompense généreusement de tels sombres sacrements – les sorciers sont dits dotés d'une durée de vie anormale et de pouvoirs démoniaques.;Die Jünger des Antichrist verstecken sich in unserer Mitte und huldigen in perfider Verderbtheit Satan, ihrem Herrn. Jede Sünde ist ihnen Hymnus, jeder Mord ein Aufschrei gegen das Wort von [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap]. Luzifer belohnt die Priester seiner dunklen Sakramente fürstlich: So heißt es, dass er Hexen ein unnatürlich langes Leben schenkt und ihnen alle möglichen dämonischen Kräfte verleiht.;;"Aquellos que sirven al Gran Adversario se ocultan entre nosotros, dedicando sus depravaciones y perfidias a su señor, Satanás.
