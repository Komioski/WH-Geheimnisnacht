####################
EVTDESC_MUTATION_2;By the Gods! You wake up with a terrible itch somewhere on your body, and when you turn to scratch, it feels like you poked yourself in the eye. You've grown a third eye!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_2A;Noooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_2B;*gasp* I'll... pluck it... out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_2BB;I'll cleanse myself, no matter what!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_2AB;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_3;Over the last couple of days, a part of your body has been growing strange hair... it has gotten worse, and you now have a small patch of fur somewhere on your body!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_3A;Noooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_4;Your fellows have been telling you lately to take a bath in no uncertain terms, but no matter how much you scrub, the smell just won't go away. A foul mutation is causing you to reek!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_4A;Noooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_5;Lately your hand has been slowly transforming, and one day, you wake to discover a huge claw where once your hand was! Curses, this is going to be hard to hide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_5A;Noooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_5B;Oh Gods, I'll need to get the meat cleaver...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_6;It's subtle at first, but you can't deny it any longer - your appearance is slightly turning into that of an animal, whether a cat, dog, cow, or deer... it's not a full transformation, but it's impossible to cover up any longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_6A;I'll need to go into hiding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_7;Some part of your body is undergoing serious changes - whether it's your feet turning into hoofs or a shell growing on your back, this is becoming impossible to hide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_7A;I'll need to go into hiding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_8;Your body is mutating faster and faster, and you are turning into some kind of beast! Your mind is starting to crack under the pressure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_8A;I'll need to go into hiding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_9;You have been struck by a terrible mutation - your body is literally falling apart and rotting, but it is no normal disease! It won't take long until you are a lump of twisted flesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_9A;I'll need to go into hiding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_10;By all the gods... you wake up one morning to hear someone screaming next to you, and turn to find that you have grown a second head which looks at you in horror and screams into your face with foetid breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_10A;*Turn to the head and scream back* AAHHHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_11;After all the mutations, you barely look like your former self. Your body is strangely misshapen and normal people will hate and fear you whenever they find you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_12;Your mortal body could no longer endure the effects of mutations - you've become a Chaos Spawn - mindless creature in service of the Ruinous Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation13;Mutations are a sign of Chaos, and signs of Chaos must be rooted out with fire and sword! You should probably check this court for signs of mutants while you're here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation14;Curses! The Witch Hunter at your court has spied on you, and discovered your mutation! This is surely the end, for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation14a;I will appeal to my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation15;My liege! I must confess... it is true I have been horribly mutated by Chaos, but I do not serve the Ruinous Powers, I swear it! I am an innocent victim - please do not trust the Witch Hunter's accusations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation15a;Unclean abomination, death by fire for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation15b;Very well, I shall show mercy. But see a surgeon at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation15c;I will not slay you, but nor will I let you roam free...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation16;You come out of hiding, but your mutations are so advanced that the first courtier who sees you screams and flees in horror shouting for the guards. Soon you are surrounded, but despite your pleas for mercy, one of them stabs you, and the others quickly follow through!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation16a;Goodbye, cruel world...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mutation17;A fellow realm ruler has been killed by his own guards, after he came out of his quarters horribly mutated. It is the topic of gossip all over the realm these days. These are truly terrible times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1002;The Chaos Gods have twisted and stretched your body to its limit, to the point you can barely recognize yourself any more. The many mutations have turned you into a horrific display of horns, scales and unnatural appendages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1002A;Grlblgh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1003;More and more mutations have reshaped your body, turning you into a monstrous being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1003A;Not entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1004;The Chaos Gods have undoubtedly touched you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1004A;It's true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1006;The voices never shut up, sometimes reality changes before you in a blink of an eye: friend turns to foe, night to day. Is there anything at all real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1006A;Blreagh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1007;Sometimes you just think all reality is part of a dream. And you are the dreamer. Those poor fools, not understanding they're just figments of your imagination...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1007A;Ah, idiots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1008;People sometimes look at you strangely, as if they were hiding something, but they never give you a straight answer if you inquire about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1008A;People are strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1009;You've long followed the gods, trusted in their blessing and kept on honouring them in your every action, yet their gaze has not touched you, you've not received their gifts and have been left, with the voices in your head tormenting and berating you. The gods cursed and left you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1009A;Nooorrrgh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1010;You cannot stand it any more: the powers of Chaos running through your body can no longer be contained by your will. With a shrieking sound your flesh twists and rips open as you turn into a mindless abomination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1010A;AAArglrluablhjggghhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1011;Your existence of continued torment and hate as finally come to an end: whatever is left of your body collapses, completely ripped into shreds by the stuff of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_1011A;Gblurrggrhasghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20005;You feel a itch on your nose, but when you raise your hand to scratch it, you find yourself grasping at a growing hard beak, quickly taking it's place over your whole face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20006;You awoke with a sense of choking. You gasped, searching for air, but something large and wet is blocking your mouth. It takes some time to realize it is your very tongue, overgrown and extended to unnatural proportions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20007;Your teeth fall one after another. In their place long and rotten fangs sprout, until you can barely speak coherently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20008;More and more eyes open on your face, then your neck and, after that, your whole body is covered by blinking appendages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_MUTATION_20009;Something it's irritating your eyes, but the more you scratch them, the more they burn. When you finally find peace, you realize your eyes have turned into bulging reptile-like things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
opinion_mutant;Mutant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
