ogre_eat_prisoner_desc;Ogres are known for their appetite and cannibalistic tendencies. Eat [Root.GetFirstName] to gain prestige and piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be growing to be quite the plump ogre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is eating less then expected. If [From.GetSheHe] continues like this, [From.GetSheHe]'ll be a laughing stock for the tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4002;This will NOT stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms4002;Worse for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4003;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has not taken well your resistence to hunger. After a good beating, [From.GetSheHe] has started to force you to take your daily portion of meat and then some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4003;Bleah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsrandoms5;You've spent a good childhood, taking always as much food as you could and now it well shows as you are one of the largest ogres of your tribe, tough and intimidating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsrandoms5;You might have had some hit and miss during your childhood, but you've certainly tried your best taking as much food as you could. If nothing else, you've certainly grown to be an ogre of a respectable size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsrandoms5;You didn't care much for appeasing your own hunger, letting other children of the tribe taking the best meat and now it shows. Many in the tribe push you around and laugh at your weakly constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms5;As it should be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms5;Bah…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms6;Ogre Chieftains are respected for the girth of their belly. As you are of a relatively weak constitution, many of your warriors have come to believe you not to be the better choice for a leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms6;They're wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms7;You take the puny [From.GetFirstName] between your arms and start savagely taking chomps off of the poor screaming creature until only a few polished bones remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms7;*Burp*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
