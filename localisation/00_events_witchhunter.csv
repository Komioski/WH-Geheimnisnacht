EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_0;Witch Hunters are a necessary evil - though their methods can be cruel, they are often the first and last line of defence against the spread of Chaos. As the holder of a major religious site, you have several Witch Hunters in your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_0A;I feel safer already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_1;Part of your demesne bears the taint of Chaos. Your courtiers and local lords want you to call in a professional to track down the root of this evil, and cleanse it from your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_1A;We must send for a Witch Hunter immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_1B;No, Witch Hunters cause too much trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_2;A local lord has sent a request to you, asking your aid in uncovering and rooting out the taint of Chaos in their land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_2A;I leave immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_3;A Witch Hunter arrives in your court. They will begin the investigation immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_3A;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_4;You arrive at the court. Now, it's time to get to work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_4A;Indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_5;You've done what you can here. It's time to move on again and root out new evils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_5A;Indeed, time to return to the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_6;The Witch Hunter comes to your council meeting and informs you that they have done their best to burn out the taint in your demesne. While there is always potential for further 'improvement', they must now leave for other lands where the foul taint of heresy must be cleansed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_6A;It was about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_7;The Witch Hunter, unusually polite, asks permission to start rooting out the foul taint of Chaos in your demesne. The methods will be harsh, but they promise to find any hidden threats and purify your land with sword and flame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_7A;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_7B;No, leave the peasants alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_8;No one is immune to the taint of Chaos, and while it is better to burn an entire village than risk contamination by one individual, you must be more careful here in the court. But there is one courtier who you suspect to be a cultist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_8A;I will confront this individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_9;You are confronted by the Witch Hunter currently investigating your court, who asks you to explain certain suspicious actions of yours...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_9A;I... ehh, heresy? No no, let me explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_10;The suspected heretic had a good explanation for their suspicious behaviour. They seems to be telling the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_10A;Fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_10B;A good cultist is a good liar! This is proof of guilt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_11;The courtier did not had a good explanation. You must inform the liege of this heretic in our midst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_11A;At once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_12;The Witch Hunter is accusing you of crimes most foul, a sure death sentence if they get their way. What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_12A;Banish him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_12B;Imprison him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_12C;Appeal to my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_13;My liege, the Witch Hunter has accused me of heresy. These charges are completely baseless, I implore you to intervene on my behalf and clear my good name! In the name of all that is holy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_13A;All heretics must die by fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_13B;I'm sure you are not a heretic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_13C;To the dungeons with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_14;Your liege sides with your accuser. The Witch Hunter has already won the loyalty of your personal guards, who seize you and drag you to the court yard where a great pyre is being prepared for your execution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_14A;Nooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_15;Your liege sides with the Witch Hunter. Your own guards seize you, and drag you to the dungeons. At least your liege was merciful, and did not condemn you to purification by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_15A;Nooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_16;Your liege intervenes, and the Witch Hunter - grudgingly - backs off. You will not suffer death by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_16A;A close call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_17;You have managed to burn the taint of Chaos from the province. But there may still be cultists and heretics lurking about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_17A;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_18;The Witch Hunter has purged the taint of Chaos from your demesne province, but warns you that heretics and cultists may still be about. He will continue his investigation for a while yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_18A;Good job, Witch Hunter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_19;No one is immune to the taint of Chaos, and while it is better to burn an entire village than risk contamination by one individual, you must be more careful here in the court. But there is one courtier who you suspect to be a cultist...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_19A;I will confront this individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_20;You are confronted by the Witch Hunter currently investigating your court, who asks you to explain certain suspicious actions of yours...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_20A;I... ehh, heresy? No no, let me explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_21;The courtier had a good explanation. They seems to be telling the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_21A;Fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_21B;A good cultist is a good liar! This is proof of guilt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_22;The courtier did not had a good explanation. You must inform the liege of this heretic in our midst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_22B;At once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_23;The Witch Hunter is accusing you of crimes most foul, a sure death sentence if they get their way. What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_23A;Banish him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_23B;Imprison him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_23C;Appeal to my liege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_24;My liege, the Witch Hunter has accused me of heresy. These charges are completely baseless, I implore you to intervene on my behalf and clear my good name! In the name of all that is holy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_24A;All heretics must die by fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_24B;I'm sure you are not a heretic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_24C;To the dungeons with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_25;Your liege sides with your accuser. The Witch Hunter has already won the loyalty of your personal guards, who seize you and drag you to the court yard where a great pyre is being prepared for your execution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_25A;Nooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_26;Your liege sides with the Witch Hunter. Your own guards seize you, and drag you to the dungeons. At least your liege was merciful, and did not condemn you to purification by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_26A;Nooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_27;Your liege intervenes, and the Witch Hunter - grudgingly - backs off. You will not suffer death by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_27A;A close call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_28;You receive word from one of the more 'militant' sects of your faith. They'd like you to host a Witch Hunter for a while, so as to curtail any potential heresy in your land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_28A;Sure... why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_28B;No! Witch Hunters cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_29;This noble of your realm has been burned alive by the Witch Hunters, on suspicion of heretical activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_29A;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_29B;Do not bother me with such news again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_30;There are known vampires in the realm... these must be rooted out with fire, stakes, silver and faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_30A;I must inform my liege at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_31;My liege, there are known vampires infesting your realm! These must be hunted down at once. Will you give the order to cleanse the land of this foul taint?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_31A;Yes, of course - get to work at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_32B;No, leave them alone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_33;Your liege has ordered that open vampires in the realm be exterminated - fanatical peasant armies led by Witch Hunters approach with fire and silver blades, but due to your skills you manage to escape them alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_33A;My lands... lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_34;Your top liege has ordered that open vampires in the realm be exterminated, and fanatical peasants led by Witch Hunters approach with fire and silver blades. You try to run, but they manage to corner you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_34A;No, not like this - I was promised eternal life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_35;Witch Hunters are a necessary evil - though their methods can be cruel, they are often the first and last line of defence against the spread of Chaos. Since there are no Witch Hunters in your realm, do you want to invite some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_35A;Yes, immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_WITCHHUNTER_35B;No, Witch Hunters are troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_INITIATION_0;The Witch Hunters do good work. I should help them root out evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WITCHHUNTER_INITIATION_0;Ask to go;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WITCHHUNTER_INITIATION_0;It's a bad idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WITCHHUNTER_INITIATION_1;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested to join the Witch Hunters in their struggle against the heretic, even though this will forever disinherit him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WITCHHUNTER_INITIATION_1;Go with my blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTTOOLTIP_WITCHHUNTER_INITIATION_1;[This.GetTitledFirstName] becomes a Witch Hunter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCshunters2;After much deliberation, the Council-Knights have decided who will take the mantle of Grand Master of the Templars of Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAshunters2;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters1;As you're no longer capable of giving orders nor exact any of your duties, the other Masters have decided to relieve you of your position from within the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters1;Hnnnghllh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters10001;It was but a formality to convince the other Council-Knights of [From.GetFirstName]'s discharge. A new, better Templar will take [From.GetHerHis] place now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters10001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters2;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has accused you of bad conduct, reuniting the other Master Templars of the Council and claiming you are no longer fit to hold your current position within the holy congregation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters2;Absurd!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters20001;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has accused [From.GetTitledFirstName] of bad conduct, reuniting the other Master Templars of the Council and claiming [From.GetHerHim] to be unfit for duty. What is your opinion on the matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters20001;The accuse has merits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters20001;The accuse is baseless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAswhunters3;The Council has spoken: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has stained [From.GetHerHis] office with clumsiness and unholy conduct and must therefore be removed immediately, lest [From.GetSheHe] lead further corruption inside the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBswhunters3;The Council has spoken: [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s accuses are unfounded and every charge against [From.GetHerHim] should be lifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters3;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters3;Exile it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters3;The accuser was obviously misled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30001;The Council-Knights were on the side of the accuser. The Order has sentenced you to death by the stake for your unholy conduct, to cleanse the Temple from your stain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30001;Arrrgh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30002;The Council-Knights were on the side of the accuser. The Order has sentenced you to exile for your unholy conduct, you are to abandon your possessions and leave at once, never to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30002;You are mistaken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30003;Your work has been accomplished. The Council-Knights have recognized the righteousness of your charges and burned the vile apostate to cleanse the holy walls of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30003;Praised be Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30004;Your work has been accomplished. The Council-Knights have recognized the righteousness of your charges and exiled the vile apostate forever from the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30004;Yet the blasphemer still breathes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30005;The Order does not make mistakes, clearly your accuser was the one being misled, for the Council-Knights have agreed upon your innocence of all charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30005;I never doubted the Order to see the Truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters30006;Some foul power must be aiding the blasphemer, for the Council-Knights could not see the unholiness beneath them and decided to drop your charges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters30006;There are no innocents!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters4;You feel that with the impending doom of Chaos looming over all, your life cannot have a meaning, if not pledged on the defense of the world against this deadly threat. You've decided to enter the Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar and fight the wicked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters4;I'll ask my liege at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters4;Well, thinking back at it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters40001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to leave and join the Witch Hunters, to fight corruption everywhere, pledging [From.GetHerHis] life to cleanse the enemies of humanity from the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters40001;Go in the light of Sigmar, [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters40001;Nonsense, I have plans for you here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters40002;Your [GetFromRelation] understood your request and decided to grant your wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters40003;Your [GetFromRelation] did not seem to understand nor share your concerns and denied you to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters40003;But I could make a difference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters5;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI write you in dire need of help. My realm is incurring in several expenses which go beyond the capacities of my treasury. I humbly ask your Order for support in these dark time, promising I'll soon be able to repay in full the sum requested.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters5;Request granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters5;The Order has no money to spare right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters50001;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], of course we, the Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar, can lend you 500 gold. All that we ask in return is your future assistance in certain matters as they might arise. Sigmar protects,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters50002;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], sadly, I must decline your request of 500 gold. The Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar is tangled in a never-ending battle agaisnt Chaos and such a war requires our every resource. Sigmar protects,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters50002;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters6;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI, humble servant of Sigmar, send you this small sum to aid you in your battle against corruption and to show my unrelenting support for the good and virtuous Templars of the Order.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters60001;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Order gladly accepts your humble donation and takes note of your outstanding action for future reference,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters70001;Accursed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nYour attempts at obstructing our holy charge do nothing but confirm your wickedness. Be assured the Order shall not rest until your heresy has been exposed and the corruption in your realm wiped out through our Lord's blessed flames.\n\nBy the glory of Sigmar,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters70001;That went well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters70002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nDespite your virtuous charge, I've found your Order's envoys to be nothing but agitators and murderers. Although this might be through none of your or your noble peers's fault, I see it no longer in my interest to allow the agents of the Order to roam within my realm.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters70002;The slyness betrays [FromFrom.GetHerHis] heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters8;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI see now the error of our ways and desire to immediately make ammends for our past mistakes by opening once more my realm's gates to the Holy Order's agents, so that you may continue your righteous charge here.\n\nHumbly,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters80001;Most virtuous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Order is relieved of your wise decision. We shall soon send new agents in your court to root out whatever vile heresy has sprung in your realm during our absence and properly eradicate it,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters80001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters90003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nOur agents have found interest and promise in  your [GetFromFromRelation]'s [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and, due to your existing dept towards the Order, we ask, in exchange for an extension to your charge, to receive [FromFrom.GetHerHim], to be trained as a Templar of the Order.\n\nSigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters13;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nAs you've yet to repay the Order for our generous loan to your treasury, we ask, in an exchange for an extension to your charge, to allow us to build a fortress in a province of our choosing within your borders.\n\nSigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters14;As agreed upon, a fortress has been built in [Root.GetName] to be garrisoned by the holy warriors of the Templar Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters18;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWe've found a good area within your borders to build a fortress of the Order, from which to extend our protection against heresy and corruption. The Order humbly ask to receive permission to build such a fortress in your realm.\n\nSigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters19;As agreed upon, a fortress has been built in [Root.GetName] to be garrisoned by the holy warriors of the Templar Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21;I require your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21;Granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters21;I'll pay my debt instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters21;Denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21001;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI am glad to allow [FromFrom.GetFirstName] to join the Holy Order of the Templars. May [FromFrom.GetSheHe] aid you well in your sacred quest against heresy and corruption.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I understand this request comes from my upstanding debt towards your treasury, which I am now ready to pay in exchange for the future of [FromFrom.GetFirstName].\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21002;Acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters21003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I must deny this request, for [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is very dear to me and I would not want to be departed from [FromFrom.GetHerHim] at this time.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters21003;Why? What depraved deed are they concocting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23;I require land in [From.GetName] to build a fortress for the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBswhunters23;I'll pay my debt instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters23;Denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23001;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI am glad to allow your Order to build an outpost within my borders. I am certain everyone will feel safer knowing that the Templars are protecting us.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I understand this request comes from my upstanding debt towards your treasury, which I am now ready to pay in exchange for the land in [FromFrom.GetName].\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23002;Acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters23003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nWhile I have no desire to go against the wishes of the Order, I must deny this request, for [FromFrom.GetName] is a precious part of my demesne and I'd not like to be departed from it.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters23003;Why? What depraved acts are being performed there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters24;[Root.GetTitledName],\n\nThe Order of the Templars of Sigmar will not let you stand alone against the growing darkness. Hold steady, for we will come and bear the full might of our Lord upon your enemies.\n\nBy Sigmar's grace,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters24;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters240001;[Root.GetTitledName],\n\nThe Order of the Templars of Sigmar is sympathetic to your just cause, but cannot spare men at the time being to aid you in your war.\n\nSigmar protects,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters240001;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters25;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI beseech the Holy Order for assistance against most foul enemies I am assaulted from. This unholy creatures could certainly be no match for the Templars of Sigmar.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDswhunters25;We shall join you at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCswhunters25;Not this time, sadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCswhunters27;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nThe Holy Order of the Templars of Sigmar requires your compliance for an investigation within your borders. We are certain of the collaboration of any Sigmar-fearing good ruler.\n\nHumbly,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAswhunters27;Request granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
