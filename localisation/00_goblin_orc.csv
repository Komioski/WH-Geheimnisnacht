creature_orc;Orc;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_orc_desc;This character is an Orc. Orcs are large, brawny greenskins which naturally dominate any smaller greenskins. The boss of a tribe is usually the largest and meanest, but it is not unknown for an unusually cunning or magically-gifted orc to maintain control through other means. Orcs love to fight and win, but are also partial to shouting, drinking and building large ramshackle constructions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_goblin;Goblin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_goblin_desc;This character is a Goblin. Goblins are smaller greenskins, but make up for their size with exceptional cunning. Goblins typically serve as fodder for orc armies, but if a tribe of goblins manages to kill or drive off their orc bosses, they will strike out on their own and attempt to carve out their own domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_snotling;Snotling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_snotling_desc;This character is a Snotling. Snotlings are small, cowardly and stupid greenskins, possessing a demeanour and intelligence comparable to an eager puppy dog. As such, they naturally follow any orc or goblin which cares to assert authority over them. Snotlings serve their masters happily until they are killed by misadventure, combat or lunch. In battle they wield whatever they can think to grab, such as pointy sticks, bones or large mushrooms, and are usually completely ineffective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Greenskins don't have a concept of law beyond strength, and thus ignore the De Jure laws of any realm. They can also freely revoke the titles of any non-Greenskin vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
