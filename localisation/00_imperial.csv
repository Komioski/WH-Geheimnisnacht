EVTDESCA_DR_imperial_religious_peace;Since 1359 IC, the three major cults of Ulric, Sigmar and Taal have been vying for supremacy within the Empire through the use of Imperial Claimants.

EVTDESCA_DR_imperial_religious_peace_chaos;Since 1359 IC, the three major cults of Ulric, Sigmar and Taal have been vying for supremacy within the Empire through the use of Imperial Claimants.

EVTDESC_DR_imperial_religious_peace_alliance_vampire;The Undead Hordes have pushed the Imperial Claimants to humility, forced to send an envoy to your realm with pleas of assistance against the threat of the Undead Hordes and dire implications of what would happen should they break the imperial lines...\n Your advisors push you to accept the alliance to stop the advance before they can pose a threat to your own borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DR_imperial_religious_peace_alliance_vampire_imperial;An envoy from your rival to the Imperial Throne has arrived at your court pleading for an alliance to stop the undead menace that threatens both of your realms. \n Your Advisors remind you that should you win the war against the Undead, the rivalry between the two of you would surely continue afterwards.

EVTTITLE_DR_imperial_religious_peace_alliance_yes;I shall accept this treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

unification4A;Well said. Let all old divisions be settled.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unification5desc;You have announced your rejection of this false new Emperor, but some of your vassals are not pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
unification5A;Bah, let them grumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TITstirabsorbs.02;Annexation;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCstirabsorbs.02;Following the Vampire Wars, the vampiric usurpers have at last been driven from the Empire of Sigmar.

EVTweaponry.1;Grudge Settler;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCweaponry.1;You have been chosen as the Reiksmarshal of the Empire by your liege. It is a great honor and the sword that comes with it is legendary.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCweaponry.2;The ruler of the Empire has decided to name you [From.GetHerHis] personal champion, truly a great honor!;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTweaponry.3;For the Empire!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAweaponry.2;This is the most glorious day in my life!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAweaponry.3;For Sigmar!;;;;;;;;;x
reiksguard.02;Reiksguard;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_reiksguard.02;Your [GetFromRelation] has come before you, requesting to join the Reiksguard. Allowing this would surely bring prestige to your house, but you will have to pay for proper weapons, armor, a mount, heraldry, a retinue...;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTOPTA_reiksguard.02;Bah, [From.GetSheHe] would probably just embarass me.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_reiksguard.02;Go and make me proud, [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;x,
reiksguard.05;Homecoming;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_reiksguard.05;Your [GetFromRelation] has served for some time in the Reiksguard and now returns home, but [From.GetHerHis] scars show proof that it has been a hard life.;;;;;;;;;x

reiksguard.07;Homecoming;;;;;;;;;x

reiksguard.09;Homecoming;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_reiksguard.09;A group of riders approached your gate this morning, telling a gruesome tale. During a skirmish with some Greenskins, your [GetFromRelation] was captured and when they mounted a rescue the next day, they found [From.GetHerHim] crippled. Apparently the boss wanted to leave a message.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_reiksguard.09;Savages!;;;;;;;;;x
reiksguard.11;Homecoming;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_reiksguard.11;Your [GetFromRelation] has come home from the Reiksguard unscathed, truly a rarity. The respect of [From.GetHerHis] soldiers escorting [From.GetHerHim] back are clear for all to see. Your [GetFromRelation] has become a true leader.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_reiksguard.11;I knew you would make me proud!;;;;;;;;;x
reiksguard.13;Homecoming;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_reiksguard.13;After leaving the Reiksguard due to an incident involving booze, a rope and a stallion, your [GetFromRelation] has returned a troubled [From.GetManWoman], often waking screaming in the night.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_reiksguard.13;Oh my...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SoA_500;Pie eating and revelry amongst family and friends is seen as the highest form of praise for the Halfling patron godess Esmerelda, the goddess of home and hearth.

The week-long celebration involves pie-eating contests, awards for the most delicious or most unique pie recipes, and general feasting and revelry. The holiday has understandably become one of the most widely celebrated aspects of Halfling culture and religious life outside The Moot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_501;How kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_501;Unfortunately, I have other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_502;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your invitation to the Pie Week jubilee, claiming [From.GetSheHe] has other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_502;More for me, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_503;The Jubilee has begun, with pies of every variety and filling occupying huge tables in the banquet hall. Songs of home and hearth are sung in thanks to Esmerelda while rivers of beer and mead flow from enormous casks in the banquet hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_503;I hope I have enough room for seconds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_504;The jubilee of pies and drink lasts all day and night for the entire week, but all good things must end. Your vassals return home to digest, but most seem to agree that the pies and drink were worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_504;I'm stuffed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_505;The jubilee of pies and drink lasts all day and night for the entire week, but all good things must end. You must return home to digest, but you and most of the other guests seem to agree that the pies and drink were worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_EMPIRE_1;Emperor [From.GetBestName] reminds you about your duty to provide the State with troops. What will be your response?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_EMPIRE_1A;It is my sacred duty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# IMPERIAL MINOR TITLES
#
title_reiksmarshal;Reiksmarshal;;;;;;;;;x
title_reiksmarshal_desc;This is the title granted to the commanders of the armed forces of the Empire. As such, [From.GetSheHe] holds power second only to the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;x
title_empire_champion;Champion;;;;;;;;;x
title_empire_champion_desc;This is the chosen champion of the Empire. Mostly an honorary title, yet it holds a certain prestige.;;;;;;;;;x
title_court_witchhunter;Court Witchhunter;;;;;;;;;x
title_court_witchhunter_desc;Witch hunters have long commanded respect, the nature of their work demands it. There are hundreds of whispered tales about their deeds, some little more than legends, others terrifyingly recent. Hence the common belief in a cohesive, shadowy agency of chaos hunters, spread across the Empire and beyond. The truth of course, is far more complex.;;;;;;;;;x
