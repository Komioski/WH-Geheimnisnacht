dark_crystal_desc;One of the scrying spheres which gave the Jade their name. Through them the serpent-vampires can establish a link with the Imperial City and the Heavenly Dragon-Emperor of Cathay. Most of the renegate Jade are not keen doing so, for it gives an opportunity to the Dragon-Emperor to read their thoughts and impose them commands, but going for too long without watching a crystal can grievously weaken them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
