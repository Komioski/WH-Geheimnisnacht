ice_witch_sisterhood;Ice Witch Sisterhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ice_witch_sisterhood_desc;Formed over a thousand years ago by the Khan-Queens, the Ice Witches have manoeuvered their way into influencing almost all matters in Kislev. They strive to ensure almost nothing is beyond their reach. They suppress competing philosophies and magic and promote those sympathetic to their causes. Even the cults have been carefully monitored and guided through the centuries. The Witches are keen to ensure no Kislevite religion ever gains the same all-encompassing power seen in other Old World nations, as such supremacy often heralds the suppression of their kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_QUEEN_0;The Khan-Queen's Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_QUEEN_0;This blade has been passed down through the ages from Tzarina to Tzarina, Mother to daughter, since Miska gave it to her daughter Shoika. In keeping with this time honored tradition, the blade is now yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_QUEEN_0;May my enemies fall as did Miska's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_TOG_3100;Kremlin Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TOG_3100;The Kremlin Guard have proven themselves to be formidable warriors in the past during the time of Igor the Terrible. You have managed to reorganize a great many of their number back into a personal guard loyal only to the [Root.GetTitle].\n\nThe Kremlin Guard will not only form a powerful shock force against the Empire's many enemies, but their foreign roots should also preclude them from becoming too entangled in the palace intrigue and power struggles that are so commonplace in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_TOG_3100;They shall serve me well.;Ils devraient bien me servir.;Sie werden mir gut dienen.;;Me servirán bien.;;;;;;;;;x

# THE ERENGRAD REPUBLIC
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_0;Rebellious Erengrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_0;The important trade city of Erengrad rebelled against their suzerain ruler in Kislev during the civil war during the succession crisis several decades ago. While they have made no claims of being above the [Root.GetTitle], they have set a dangerous precedent for other would-be secessionists. Their continued refusal to submit willingly has only served to inflame tensions.\n\nWhile we are justified in launching a punitive expedition, the burghers may yet convince us to accept their pretense of self-rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_0;The rebellious burghers have defied my will for too long!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_0;Their coin could make a very convincing argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# WHAT TO DO WITH THE VECHE
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_1;Fate of the Erengrad Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_1;The center of Republican rule in Erengrad has long been its Veche, the seat of their burgher republic. As a powerful symbol of their popular rule, and the administrative heart of their republic, destroying it will break their will and discourage any further discussion of self-rule. However, allowing them to retain it will be seen as a gesture of the [Root.GetTitle]'s mercy, and will do much to cement their loyalty to the [Root.GetTitle] in Kislev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche burns. Their defiance cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche shall remain at the pleasure of the [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# THE TZAR/TZARINA DEMANDS A BRIBE
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_2;The Kislevite Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_2;The ignoble sovereign in Kislev has given us the option to pay a monthly bribe or risk their might. While there is reason to believe that such threats are baseless posturing, a refusal still risks the independence of our Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_2;Our continued independence is worth a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_2;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# BRIBE RECIEVED
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_3;Threats Pay Off;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_3;The burghers of Erengrad have agreed to pay us a hefty sum to ensure that they remain independent. While they are certainly not happy about being forced to part with any coin, our threat of our invasion no longer stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_3;I made them an offer they couldn't refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# THREATS REBUFFED
#
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_4;Erengrad Unmoved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_4;The arrogant burghers of Erengrad have foolishly denied your just demand. In response to your most humble request, the patricians of the city have replied only with insults and affronts to your dignity as their rightful suzerain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_4;Their folly will soon be made clear to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# KISLEVITE MELTING POT

U_EVTDESC55002;For a long time we Gospodars ruled here and we shed our blood with other people of these lands. The time has come to unite with them and create a new great Kislev!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTOPTA55002;Let there be one nation, one people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55003;Gospodars, Ungols and other people of Kislev once divided are now creating family bonds and adopting a new identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55004;More and more people in Kislev are adopting a new identity. Some of the courtiers have also embraced new ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55005;The whole realm has adopted new Kislevarin. My servants inform me that it is increasingly popular to show new customs and speak new Kislevarin amongst Ungol and Gospodar Boyars and Szlachta...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
U_EVTDESC55006;My wise liege has persuaded me to adopt new customs and a new identity - I am not Gospodar or Ungol, now I've become a Kislevite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# KISLEVITE
#
EVTDESC_KISLEV_1;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested to join the Gryphon Legion in their struggle against the enemies of Kislev. The Gryphon Legion is an elite winged lancers company. While they fight as mercenaries in the whole Old World, they are still fiercely loyal to Kislev and always defend it when the situation demands it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_1;Make us proud!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KISLEV_1;Absolutely not!;C'est hors de question ! ;Auf keinen Fall!;;¡Me niego por completo!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_KISLEV_2;In his wisdom your liege has allowed you to leave court for the Gryphon Legion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KISLEV_3;Your liege didn't give you permission to join the Gryphon Legion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_3;Cursed fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# AFTER BIRTH CEREMONY DAZH GRANTS PROTECTION
#
EVTDESC_KISLEV_5;In Kislev every newborn infant is to be commended to the protection of Dazh. It is expected of you to follow this ancient tradition, prepare the ceremonial fire and invite the most important members of the holding to the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_5;Tradition is everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KISLEV_5;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESCA_KISLEV_6;The guests have gathered and the ceremony has started. Together with the child's mother, you pass the baby through the flames of the ceremonial fire, symbolically burning away any bad luck or Chaos taint... as you do it, the baby starts crying - a sign of a good luck! Dazh has granted your child his protection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KISLEV_6;The ceremony starts and the whole court has gathered to witness it. Together with the child's mother, you pass the baby through the flames of fire, symbolically burning away any bad luck or Chaos taint... as you do it, the mother notices that the baby is noticeably burned! Bad luck! Dazh refused to granted your [From.GetBestName] his protection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_KISLEV_6;The ceremony is starting, and all the courtiers have gathered to witness it. You stand by the fire, and pass the baby through the flames to its mother, symbolically burning away any bad luck or Chaos taint... Suddenly, the baby slips from your hands directly into the flames. This must be a sign from Dazh! The baby is tainted with Chaos! You are restrained and there is nothing you can do to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_6;Dazh be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KISLEV_6;The gods have forsaken us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_KISLEV_6;Nooooo! My baby!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESCA_KISLEV_8;Living so far north brings the danger of Chaos corruption. Amongst the Ungols, it is the Wise Women who guard the tribe against the taint and dispose of those touched by Chaos. A Wise woman of your tribe came to see your child. During the ceremony, she will check if the newborn is free from the influences of Chaos...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_8;Let the spirits be merciful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESCA_KISLEV_9;The Hag has declared that the child carries Chaos taint and has to be removed from the Stanitsa. In the northern regions, the Chaos threat is all too real and no one dares to oppose the Wise Women. It is the last time that you see your baby [chaos_tainted.GetBestName], the Hag will take it and now there's nothing to do but mourn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_KISLEV_9;Gods be praised! The Stanitsa Hag have not found any taint in your child! Yet, before leaving she marked your baby with a curse: [chaos_tainted.GetHagsCurse];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KISLEV_9;Gods why!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KISLEV_9;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_KISLEV_9;Never! We will not allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He ordered the infamous beheading of the members of the Boyar family of Melnikovs, destroying almost every single member of that family, for he had a dream that a young man named Melnikov toppled his Kingdom. The taxes he assessed the poor people of Kislev were enormous and were ruthlessly collected by his cruel servants. Thousands died during his regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Wardrobe
#
EVTDESCwardrobe.0;You've grown restless these past few weeks and once again find yourself unable to sleep, pacing in circles about your room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_0;Perhaps I should explore the castle a little?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.1;You begin to wander the twisting halls of the castle, exploring the occasional room, finding little of note. But in one room you notice a large wardrobe hidden in the shadows, strangely you can't help but feel a sense of malice eminating from the thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_1A;It's getting late... I should get back to my room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_1B;Where did this come from?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.11;Without taking your eyes off the wardrobe, you back out of the room. Only after it's out of sight do you turn around and sprint back to your quarters, slamming the door behind you and leaping into your bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_11;Close your eyes and get some sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.12;You move cautiously closer to the wardrobe to investigate. It resonates with an icy chill. Elaborate motifs of snowy forests and frozen rivers are carved into the wood and iron. It's truly beautiful, you feel as if you can't look away and reach a hand out to touch it. Before you realize what you've done, you've opened the door and crawled inside, with the door shutting itself firmly behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_12;How deep is this thing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.2;Suddenly, you stumble out of the back of the wardrobe. The first thing you notice isn't the trees, or the freshly fallen snow, its the biting unbearable cold. Your teeth chatter as you bundle yourself in some old furs from the wardrobe and head down a nearby path. It's not long before you come upon a fork... Which way now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_2A;Take the left fork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_2B;Take the right fork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.21;After wandering down the path for what seems like hours, your fingers and toes begin to feel numb from the cold and you begin to think longingly of the warm bed waiting in your quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_21;I've been here far too long, time to get home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.3;After wandering down the path for several minutes you stumble into a small clearing. densely packed with ruined buildings clustered around a small well. As you wander towards the center of what you presume is an abandoned town, you feel an ominous presence directly around the next corner. An overwhelming sense of dread fills your very bones as you catch a glimpse of a terrible beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_3A;Make a run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_3B;Hide! Quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.31;Without a moments hesitation, you turn around and sprint in the direction of the wardrobe. When you are just a few feet away, you glance back but whatever it was chose not to follow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_31;Quickly climb back inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.31;making it back safely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.32;The beast notices you immediately and sinks a serrated claw into your thigh as you try to escape, dragging you towards its jagged maw. You manage to kick free of the beast and struggle to your feet. Adrenaline fills your veins as you stumble to the wardrobe and crawl inside, thankful that the thing didn't chase after you. You emerge and collapse to the floor covered in blood. The wardrobe slowly merges with the wall behind you as you call out for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_32;Help! I'm hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.32;it seeing you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.33;Without thinking you duck into the nearest doorway and crawl under the remains of what appears to be a bed. After waiting for what felt like hours without making a sound, you feel the presence recede and you cautiously crawl from your hiding place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_33;Take a look around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.33;going unnoticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.4;Though the room is dark and covered in decay, you know something terrible has happened here. You head towards the doorway to leave, when you notice a faint purple glow coming from a large gemstone built into the mantle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_4A;What's this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPwardrobe.4A;Reach out and touch the gemstone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_4B;Leave it where it is and get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.41;As you lay your hand upon the stone, it flashes with a blinding purple light and you feel a strange power surge through you! You can't help but exclaim loudly in surprise and elation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_41;Head back to the wardrobe, that thing might have heard you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCwardrobe.5;As you emerge from the hulking wardrobe, you are struck by a strong nausea and collapse, as the room spins around you. It takes several moments to regain your senses. The wardrobe is gone and the sun is shining through the nearby window...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTwardrobe_5;Was it all a dream?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
