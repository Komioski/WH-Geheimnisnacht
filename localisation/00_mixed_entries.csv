warp_khorne;§RKhorne§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warp_khorne_desc;Khorne, the Blood God, sits resplendent in his rage upon his brass throne, resting atop a mountain of bloody skulls, built from the countless heads of great champions his followers have slain over an immeasurable number of eons. No mortal man would be able to lay their eyes upon Khorne and survive, but various heretical writers have suggested that the Blood God looks somewhat like one of his mighty Bloodthirster greater daemons, only infinitely more terrifying. Khorne sits upon his throne, encased in his brass armor, capable of deflecting any blow, clutching his colossal sword that could carve continents into pieces, his eyes burning with endless fury in the centre of his dog-like face. Khorne is said to have mighty forges and armouries that run for leagues, belching sooty filth into the lightning-cracked air, yet he will forever favour this single combination of arms. His mighty throne room, built atop of his great brass tower, is supported by eight gigantic brass pillars in honour of the sacred number of the Blood God. \n\n His lands in the Realm of Chaos are barren, cracked and dry save for the ceaseless rivers of blood fuelled by endless combat. Throughout his realm, legions of warriors fling themselves into combat purely for the sake of battle. Khorne cares not from where blood flows and skulls are sacrificed so long as it is done in his name. It is not uncommon to see the warriors and champions of Khorne fighting amongst themselves, duelling and battling to prove their skill in combat and rise higher in the eyes of their Lord. Khorne disdains magic; to him, only bloodletting through physical combat is acceptable. None of his followers are permitted to be sorcerers, although some will carry magic-imbued weapons or armor in order to augment their killing ability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warp_slaanesh;§PSlaanesh§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warp_slaanesh_desc;Slaanesh, called among other things the Prince of Chaos and the Dark Prince, is the youngest of the Ruinous Powers. His is the domain of decadence and excess, but only a fool believes that Slaanesh is concerned only with the idle pleasures of the flesh. Rather, Slaanesh is fuelled by extremes of sensation, experience, and emotion. The Dark Prince of Chaos grants the power to excel in all things, pushing those who serve him far beyond the normal limits of human passion, desire, and obsession. None have dreamed until they have dreamed of the power Slaanesh can grant, their horizons expanding infinitely in the very instant their soul is forfeited. \n\n The territory of the Dark Prince of Chaos can be imagined as a peninsular of spirit-matter, a spit of land which, while nowhere near as expansive as that claimed by other gods, is supremely defensible, and utterly under the sway of Slaanesh. Unlike the other Ruinous Powers, especially Khorne, Slaanesh does not maintain a fortress or stronghold as such. Instead, his court is found inside a vast, shimmering pavilion where the every excess contrived by humanity is practised to the utmost degree. It is said that this terrible place heaves with such extremes of emotion and experience that it radiates into the dreams and desires of mortals, stoking hidden flames and nurturing secret desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warp_nurgle;§GNurgle§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warp_nurgle_desc;Nurgles worshippers can be said to be the most joyous of mortals, but it is the insane glee of those who have resigned themselves to damnation. Nurgle is depicted as an immense monster whose scabrous flab is the hue of decomposing flesh. His paunch, swollen with corpse-gas, spills stinking organs, and a legion of daemonic mites play among his entrails and suckle the discharge streaming from his sores. Fat flies hum around his antlered head. His blubbery, pustulated face wears an amiable smile of contentment. His sacred number is seven, and his symbol incorporates a triangle of three circles representing the unending cycle of birth, suffering, and death. Mythology represents the Lord of Decay dwelling within a dilapidated fortress-mansion located in the Realm of Chaos, the infernal abode of the Ruinous Powers that exists beyond mortal concepts of time and physical matter. \n\n Within the crumbling walls of his workshop, beneath a mildewed ceiling sagging with damp, Nurgle toils before a steaming cauldron. He beams with excitement as he mixes strains of pox and fever to create a poisonous stew of pestilence, for although every known disease infects his monstrous body, he is obsessed with creating new ailments. When he is satisfied by his efforts, he pours the concoction into the grate below, and chortles with happiness as he watches the nauseating plagues rain down upon the world. He is most generous in bequeathing his diseases to mortals, all of whom he regards with great affection, and he ensures that rich and poor alike share the rotten fruits of his labour. Nurgle is not a god of destruction  he cherishes all life. The spluttering of the newborn babe is as dear to him as the slithering of the maggot hatched in its gut. It is simply unfortunate that the most prevalent forms of life  the unseen worms, viruses, and bacteria  are so inimical to all the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warp_tzeentch;§BTzeentch§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warp_tzeentch_desc;The Chaos god Tzeentch holds the keys to such terrible knowledge. His price, however, is steep  his worshippers become pawns in his incessant game to undermine civilisation and to outflank his fellow Ruinous Powers. Tzeentch rewards his followers with mutation and insanity, and when they die, he claims their souls as his playthings. Tzeentch is known by a thousand epithets. He is the Weaver of All Fates, who spins a tangled web to achieve his incomprehensible ends. He is the Great Conspirator, whispering evil counsel in the ears of monarchs, and nurturing murderous ambition and rebellion among their subjects. He plucks the strings of jealousy and resentment to make evil-minded men and women dance like marionettes at his command. \n\n Tzeentchs worshippers believe that he reigns from an Impossible Fortress deep in the Realm of Chaos. At its heart, protected by a crystal labyrinth of inconceivable geometry, is the Hidden Library, a hall of eternal dimensions that stores all the knowledge of the universe. Tzeentch stares for eons into the Well of Eternity for clues from the past and the future that will help him fulfil his schemes. When Tzeentch stirs from his reverie, treachery, insanity, mutation, and strife afflict the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

chaos_destrier_desc;Chaos Steeds are not normal horses, but coal-black chargers with daemonic ichor for blood, needle-sharp teeth and the intelligence of cruel men. A Chaos Steed's head and flanks are protected by sculpted plates of thick, metal barding that no normal steed could bear, and they gore and slash those before them with bladed horns and hooves. It is said that these evil steeds are gifts from the Dark Gods themselves, and that they are subservient to their master alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warpstone_cluster_desc;A large chunk of Wyrdstone. Unrefined Warpstone is highly toxic to all living things; prolonged exposure to the substance will lead to madness, mutation and eventual death.

warpstone_dust_desc;Achieved by grinding Warpstone into a fine white powder, this dust has its greatest effect when ingested.

Herdstones are always erected in places of magical significance, usually over one of the baleful meteors that brought the Beastmen into being all those ages ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

no_beastman_herd_desc;Beastmen put great stock in their fetishes and grim totems, and will quickly festoon any camp or clearing they claim with such vile tokens.

Their trophies are draped over a totem by the Bestigor tents when in camp, but taken and worn when they roam the beast-paths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Although the blood-grounds comprise of many leagues of dread woodland there are nexus points, where the herds tend to gather, perhaps at a junction of the beast-paths, or a favoured hunting spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

no_beastpath_desc;Over millennia of use, the beast-paths have become deep ruts in the ground, strewn with the bones of the enemy and other detritus. So dense is the undergrowth that grows on the embankments, that the chances are that no human tracker or huntsman seeking a beast-path would find one simply by pure coincidence. Any huntsman who have managed to stumble upon a beast-path would be extremely wise to turn and flee, for a warherd might be travelling the path and his own bones may soon be added to those discarded upon it.;;;;;;;;;x

This isn't the most complex or reliable form of communication but as well as can be expected from a race that despises civilisation. On their travels, Centigors are known to stop in the lee of cliffs or hollows to wait out the elements, inevitably indulging in revelry, delaying messages even further.;;;;;;;;;x

But they do find great stock in man-made weapons, especially blades, for they as a race, have no skills in forging. And so a warherd's armoury must be scavenged or taken, and such relics are to be placed in a mound controlled by the Beastlord or even stood against a herdstone.;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_karak_eightpeaks;Karak Eight Peaks;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_eightpeaks_desc;Karak Eight Peaks, also known as Vala-Azril-Ungol ("Queen of the Silver Depths" in Khazalid), was one of the greatest Dwarf holds, rivaling even Karaz-a-Karak in size and power. It was located in a great bowl-shaped valley, ringed by eight high peaks. Above the surface, walls encompassed a vast area, but most of the city was built below ground. Below the earth, the city was a made up of courts and plazas with great vaulted ceilings, and further below, the tombs of the Dwarf kings and deep mines. Its fall to a combined Skaven-Night Goblin invasion meant the end of the Dwarf Golden Age. Since then, many a member of Clan Angrund has tried to reclaim their ancestral homeland from the vermin infesting it, unsuccessfully..;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_slayer_keep;Slayer Keep;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_slayer_keep_desc;Karak Kadrin, otherwise known as "Slayer Keep", is a mighty Dwarf hold that has guarded one of the few major passes through World's Edge Mountains, the Peak Pass. For countless centuries this hold has guarded the lands of Kislev and the Empire to west against greenskin threats and worse. The hold is home to the Shrine of Grimnir and is a sacred place for all would-be Slayers. The hold also has a long history of Slayer Kings who have passed down their slayer oath through generations.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_everpeak;Everpeak;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_everpeak_desc;Everpeak, Karaz-a-Karak in the language of the Dwarfs, is the ancient capital of the Dwarf empire, the "Pinnacle of Mountains", the "Most Enduring". It is the oldest and most glorious hold of the mountain folk and inside its halls is the greatest concentration of wealth in the world. Visitors have been awestruck at the magnificent beauty of the place. The most important hold politically and religiously in Dwarf culture, Karaz-a-Karak boasts of the mightiest army, greatest runesmiths and largest population out of all the Dwarf realms. It is from here that the High Kings rule and where the sacred "Great Book of Grudges" and the "Book of Remembering" are kept. It has endured countless ages against all manner of foes but it has never fallen and will endure until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_zhufbar;Zhufbar;;;;;;;;;x,,;;;;
wonder_zhufbar_desc;Zhufbar, known as the "Torrent-gate" in Khazalid, is a Dwarf hold built nestled in a deep chasm under the lake called Black Water. A huge waterfall that falls high above the city provides the necessary power for the numerous Dwarf machines that have been constructed here. The city is the principle shrine for the Engineers Guild and is a center of every kind of industry. It was here that the famed Gromril metal, which was mined from nearby Karak Varn, was smelted and forged into many famous Dwarf artifacts.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_barak_varr;Barak Varr;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_barak_varr_desc;Barak Varr, Khazalid for "Sea Gate", is a unique Dwarf hold in that it is the only Dwarf seaport in the world and houses the whole Dwarf fleet. Located at the easternmost point of the Black Gulf, the hold is built in a vast water filled cavern, carved into a cliffside which provides a natural defence for the harbor. The mighty Ironclad ships of the Dwarfs as well as numerous merchant vessels from all over the world can be found here as well, sailing in and out of the vast cavern. This hold is among the most friendly to non-Dwarfs and in turn has great revenue from trade.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_iron_peak;Iron Peak;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_iron_peak_desc;Known as "Iron Peak", Karak Azul is built with it's upper portion on a plateau overlooking the valley below, which is unusual compared to other holds. It is also the only southern Dwarf hold that has withstood the greenskin invasions over the centuries but at great cost since today Karak Azul's population is very meagre. However, many famous rune armours and weapons were and still are being made in the hold which has contributed to the continued survival of the hold.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_horn_hold;Horn Hold;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_horn_hold_desc;Karak Hirn, or "Horn Hold" in Khazalid, is the largest and wealthiest of the Black Mountain holds. Its name comes from the fact when wind blows in a certain direction, the large cavern within the hold creates a sound reminiscent of a mighty warhorn which is heard for miles around and which the Dwarfs have taken advantage of for many uses.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_copper_mountain;Copper Mountain;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_copper_mountain_desc;Translated as "Copper Mountain" in Khazalid, Karak Izor has the prestige of being the first and largest Dwarf hold outside the World's Edge Mountains. Located in the Vaults, it has access to the richest metal deposits, ranging from iron to copper and tin, outside the World's Edge Mountains and its influence is such that Dwarf settlements from all across the Vaults, and as far as the Apuccini Mountains, look to Karak Izor for protection and guidance. There is also a miniature version of the Underway being built deep beneath the Vaults which would allow unhindered trade between Dwarf settlements in the region.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_norn;Karak Norn;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_karak_norn_desc;Known as "Barren Earth Hold" in Khazalid, Karak Norn is the major hold in the Grey Mountains. Its population consists mainly of displaced clans from fallen holds across the Old World. While not being particularly wealthy because of the Grey Mountains' lack of large mineral deposits, Karak Norn does control the vital mountain passes in the southern Grey Mountains. It is also strategically placed on a high plateau above Loren Forest, to keep a close eye on the Wood Elves because of the long distrust the two races have for each other. Karak Norn is also on good terms with its neighbouring human realms and has helped both the Bretonnians and the Empire in the past.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_drak;Kraka Drak;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_kraka_drak_desc;Khazalid for Dragon Hold, the Norse Dwarfs of Kraka Drak have done much to earn their fearsome moniker. Said to be even more warlike than their cousins to the south, their entire society revolves around the virtue of war and the honor of battle, a necessary development given their location. This warlike demeanor has ensured their survival, however it has not been without a cost. Owing to their geographical remoteness, the foreignness of their customs, and the heterodox veneration of the ancestor gods as a collection of warrior aspects, they have become an isolated and culturally alien group to the rest of Dwarf-kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_crag;Black Crag;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_black_crag_desc;Black Crag, or Karak Drazh in Khazalid, is the largest and most well known Greenskin stronghold in the world. When the Dwarfs still held the Black Crag, it provided a strong defensable position in the south of the Worlds Edge mountains, and was also a very rich hold. It would survive the Time of Woes, but would fall shortly after to Greenskins, turning the once great hold into a scar on the Dwarfs honor and history.;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_dawi_karak;Dwarf Karak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_dawi_karak_desc;Dwarfen civilization revolves around the inhabitation of well-protected fortress settlements known as Holds (Karak in Khazalid) which are centered in a system of halls, chambers, and defensive barriers within the interior of a mountain. Within these holds, the Dwarfs are able to successfully mine potentially vast amounts of rare and precious metals and gems held deep in the Earth's crust, with relatively low risk of theft. The holds also allow the Dwarfs to protect the veins and deposits they have laid claim to using their own defensive tunnel and trap systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

At one point the Strigoi realm reached as far as the Black Gulf, all controlled from Mourkhain. The Orcs were far from happy at being pushed from the ancestral lands and joined together in a great Waaagh! Led by Warboss Garsnag Craktoof, Mourkhain was sacked, and the power of the Strigoi broken forever. Now known as Morgheim, the city may no longer exert its control across the Badlands but is still a formidable place of lost power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Protectors are often human males skilled in the art of war and personal combat, but it is not unheard of for the Queen to give this title to a particularly warlike Lahmian either. Vampire protectors are, after all, likely to be better fighters than mere mortals due to their natural advantages in speed and strength. Some protectors even receive magical weapons and artifacts from the Queen so that they may fight better in the inevitable conflicts with the witch hunters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It then fell during the war of vengeance in -1974 when a Dwarf army marched on it following the death of Prince Snorri Halfhand (in a duel with Caledor the 2nd). Only a small colony, the Elves abandoned Tor Ancor to its fate and it was razed to the ground soon after by the vengeful dwarfs. The city lay in ruins until human tribesmen willingly built on the ruins of the former Elf colony in -1125  seeking to make their mark as the dominant tribe in the region.

Option A: Player cannot marry outside of his race, and no one can switch to another race's religion.

temptation.1;The Embrace of Uncle Nurgle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.1_desc;The Plague Father, Fly Lord, Great Corrupter, the Master of Pestilence... Grandfather Nurgle has many titles. Within your very mind and soul you hear the maddened buzzing of a billion flies, and a chorus of choking, coughing voices whispering in your ears. They are calling you to join them in the endless bliss of utter pestilence and decay, to cast aside the facade of health and embrace the utter rottenness that is the inevitable fate of all life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Temptation.1.TOOLTIP1;Father Nurgle loves his children, hehehe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Temptation.1.TOOLTIP2;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] will give me the strength to resist this sickness in my heart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2;The Seductions of the Prince of Pleasure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2_desc;Truth, beauty, honour, justice... what do any of these things mean without pleasure? Are not the senses of Man his guide into the divine? Poetry, music, dance, wine, none of it is enough for one of your intellect and needs. Your body and mind yearn for stimulation, to seek out new experiences. You tire of the restraints of so-called "civilised society,and wonder if it might be better to seek out like-minded spirits and experiment with a new lifestyle beyond mere mortal hedonism? Your inquiring mind and almost uncontrollable lust for life leads you to the Forbidden Lord of Excess, Slaanesh, who can offer you all you desire in return for so little?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2.TOOLTIP1;Ah, what sweet ecstasy is this? I must have more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.2.TOOLTIP2;No, no, I have gone too far... [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3;The Changer of Ways Calls Ye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
temptation.3_desc;The ignorant masses cling to their Gods and laws, unaware of their own utter insignificance in the grand scheme of things. Civilisations and races rise and fall, the only constant is change - all else is illusion. One of your genius knows that the only way to survive and achieve greatness on this mortal coil is to understand the vast immaterial power of magic, and to use any means necessary to acquire that knowledge. You know that the parlour tricks of the common wizards are merely a pale reflection of the incredible powers that close-minded religious dogma denies to you. In order to better understand the Winds of Magic, and to further your own career, you've considered entering a purely temporary relationship with the daemon called Tzeentch in order to use him for your own ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Better that than to forever be surrounded by whining, ungrateful vassals and forced to listen to the false advice of effete scholars and sorcerers. Kill them, kill them all! Khorne, Master of the Skull Throne, calls you to his service. It matters not from whence the blood flows, only that it does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

temptation.5_desc;Everywhere those in power seek to blind the teaming mass of Mankind to the horrors that lurk just out of sight. The Blood God, the Changer of Ways, the Prince of Pleasure and the Great Corrupter are all names for a unspeakable force that was ancient when the mountains and the seas were young. Fools deny it, but the Ruinous Powers are very real. Those who serve them well are rewarded, or else are damned for eternity. Do you dare sell your soul to Chaos Undivided, the Primordial Annihilator - and risk all for the sake of immortality and an escape from death itself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

temptation.6_desc;You hurry through the streets, scurrying like a common criminal through the backstreets and the slums, a hood obscuring your face from sight. But you are no common thief or mere conspirator, you serve a greater power. You duck and weave your way to arranged meeting place, whispering a password in a forbidden language. Inside, you are greeted by your new brothers and sisters, and after a blood curdling ritual test you are finally inaugurated into the cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAUDSYL.1;I'll rule on this accursed land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBUDSYL.1;I've found my perfect lair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.2;My holdings are suffering from the influence of this accursed land. Dead men refuse to stay in the ground while huge flocks of what look like bats darken the skies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.2;Damn. I can't do anything to stop it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCUDSYL.3;With hard work and the blessings of the gods, the lands of Sylvania are approaching normalcy. Crops grow and the peasants live safely under my watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCUDSYL.5;I've not paid enough attention to the care of my land, and now my loyal servants have dispersed, pursued by fanatical zealots and crusading templars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAUDSYL.5;I don't care of mortal affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAUDSYL.6;I'm unstoppable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTCARSTEIN.13;Risen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHspleasure171;At first the changes are small, with an itch in your skin, then an uncomfortable creaking as your ribcage and shoulders bend and widen while the hip bone narrows.

EVTDESCslunacy2;What was that shadow? You could have sworn you heard someone whispering behind your back. Why would someone follow you in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy2;A plot?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy3;People suffer all the time, but why care? As long as you are alright, there's nothing to be sad about. In fact, how could you consider yourself well-being, if not by comparison with those who are not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy3;Their suffering makes me feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy4;All this stress plaguing your mind is just too much. You need something to calm yourself, anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy4;Some herbs might help, maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy5;Incompetent narrow-minded fools might play safe with magic, but you know better by now: one cannot truly master the Winds without taking a few risks. This last experiment might really help you better understanding the arcane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy5;Let's start now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy6;As you expected, the experiment was successful. Each day your mind opens more to the great secrets of the universe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy6;I must know more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy7;You spent an entire night of work for nothing: the secret of this spell still eludes you. All the time wasted for a failure is driving you mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy7;I need to start again! I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy8;Collateral damage is inevitable when fighting for control over the great powers of the universe. You just hoped the fire wouldn't spread to yourself as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy8;Aaargh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy9;This is the last time you have to wake up with a damning headache without remembering what you did the previous night. Alcohol is poison and you shall not submit your brilliant mind to it ever again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy9;I've better things to think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy10;Nobody is truly ever evil, the more you think about it. All people have good reasons for their actions and those who are said to be wicked are just sad and lonely being, who were probably abused when young. Why should you add to their misery by branding them as villains?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy10;There is no evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy11;You've always known to be special, but you are certain now that the Winds of Magic flow through you, granting you powers that mere mortals only dream of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy11;I'm a powerful mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy12;Most people don't see it, but in the end isn't life one big joke? You can see it now, it might be you just have keener senses or maybe you're the protagonist of this farce. Why else would other people not see the hilarity in murder or the humour in misery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy12;Ah ah ah ah ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy13;For sometime now hardly anything has been able to trigger a response for you. As time passes by not only you do not feel any passion left for your loved ones nor hatred for your enemies, your very skin has started to lose any perception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy13;I feel... nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy14;Life is something miraculous, when you take one, you can feel all of the vibrant passions and dreams of a dying soul. It lasts but a moment, it's never enough to sate your thirst for death. And off you go, searching for the next target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy14;The blood calls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy15;People have always had to look up on you, they know you're better than them in every way and so do you. Are you even one of them, you wonder? Perhaps you are something more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy15;...more than a mortal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy16;You couldn't help it, it was such a beautiful scene... The body moves now, but soon your blade shall turn it into a motionless puppet and shall be able to watch as the soul passes away into the Realm beyond...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy16;Soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy18;The crazed [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has viciously killed your [GetFromRelation]. Rumours say the horrible murder was entirely without motive but the killer's sick pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy18;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy19;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you and within a week you've left a trail of blood and mangled corpses all over your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy19;Pile the bodies, create a canal with their blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy20;A single soul is not enough to satisfy you tonight: the will of the Great Reaper pervades you, you summon the Winds of Magic at your fingertips and with a few words an entire building explodes, dragging into oblivion countless lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy20;Kaboom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy21;The crazed [From.GetFirstName] has employed [From.GetHerHis] terrible magic to blow up a building in [From.GetHerHis] own lands, killing many of [From.GetHerHis] subjects in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy21;Madness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy22;Why should the thief be hanged when he only stole out of hunger? Is it his fault if he was born poor? Why should the murderer die? Wouldn't that make the executioner a murderer as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy22;Nobody should get punished, ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy23;There was a time when you revelled in other people's suffering, but, the more you look back at those days, the more you feel as if those people only deserved your pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy23;Those poor souls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy24;You just visited your dungeons and saw a prisoner laying, chained on the wall. Why should anybody suffer like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy24;You'll be freed at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy25;With real power running through your veins you finally realize how deluded you were: only *now* you are a real mage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy25;This is amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy26;Even the most powerful wizards make mistakes from time to time. You were sure the potion would react well to your spell, but something might have gone wrong and the philtre just exploded into your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy26;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy28;That disturbing smirk, it unsettles you. [From.GetFirstName] has spent a good chunk of [From.GetHerHis] day mocking you and laughing, claiming your mind has turned into mush and you're no longer good for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the ailment affecting your body is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy28;You still have the laughter of [From.GetFirstName] echoing within your mind alongside that maniac's cruel quips on your painful disfigurement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, poking at your sides and making fun of your generous figure, one shaming snark after the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy28;[From.GetFirstName] decided to spend [From.GetHerHis] morning chuckling behind you, obviously pretending to be concerned about your frail health, not sparing jokes about you being skinnier than a shadow, barely capable of walking two steps without crumbling for exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy28;This is the third time this week [From.GetFirstName] mocks and trips you, [From.GetSheHe] thinks the illness weakening your body and plaguing your mind is something hilarious, the cynical freak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy28;Has [From.GetFirstName] no heart at all? Your pregnancy is a nightmare as it is without [From.GetHerHim] making fun at you with [From.GetHerHis] cruel jokes, patting your womb and scaring you with all the possible ways your labour could go wrong for both mother and child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy28;As if it wasn't enough trouble for you as it is, [From.GetFirstName] spent last evening cracking jokes about the corruption which is devouring your body, as if your mutations were a light topic of no real importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy28;What goes [From.GetFirstName]'s mind? The disturbed freak spent all day pointing and laughing at you as if *you* were the insane maniac in the room, rather than [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy28;Enough! Stop it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy29;Watching that miserable fool [From.GetFirstName] trying to get back at you is almost as hilarious as [From.GetHerHis] irredeemably broken mind. You can't stop to chuckle at the thought of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy29;All broken and sore, [From.GetFirstName] is such an easy target. The way [From.GetSheHe] walks, or tries to, it's the most humorous thing you saw in the week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslunacy29;Rarely one has the benefit of entertaining himself with such a fantastic opportunity as [From.GetFirstName]'s mangled body. Tearing scabs off [From.GetHerHis] scourged skin it's just the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? A land whale such as [From.GetSheHe] is, slobbering over the palace all sweaty and bloated... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslunacy29;How can so few laugh at [From.GetFirstName]? That frail little thing, with [From.GetHerHis] skin barely covering [From.GetHerHis] bones... It just calls to be pranked upon, yet people still think you are at fault, for some reason...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslunacy29;Making fun of an ill person like [From.GetFirstName] has double the fun: not only you have to think of new quips to make at [From.GetHerHim], you have to keep a safe distance to avoid sharing [From.GetHerHis] state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslunacy29;Why do other people have to always treat pregnant women with such care, as if they were something precious. Making fun at [From.GetFirstName] swollen body and sickly disposition gave you the best time of this month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslunacy29;Small imperfections are already quite enough a cause for mocking, but a full blown third eye or fifth limb? [From.GetFirstName] just called for it. If [From.GetSheHe] didn't want to be made fun of, [From.GetSheHe] shouldn't have gotten the Dark Gods' attention, it's just that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslunacy29;[From.GetFirstName] is as crazy as it goes. There's barely any point in mocking [From.GetHerHim], in the end. What else can you say that everybody hasn't thought of already? Still, that does make it quite a challenge to tackle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy29;AH AH AH AH AH AH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy30;What do you have to fear any more? No word or action can make you cry, no wound can inflame your mind with pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy30;Nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy31;Even if somebody was conspiring against you, what would be the result? A dagger through your heart feel less than the morning's air to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy31;I don't care any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy32;You're just so desperate to *feel* something. You thought a blade could pierce deep enough to trigger some response, but, despite your efforts and all the blood spilled, no pain reached your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy32;Is there any point in closing these wounds?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy33;You are marvellous and powerful god, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy33;You are beautiful and powerful goddess, it is time that your people started to treat you as such. They have to bow down and worship you, build statues in your honour, pray for you to judge mercifully their souls once they're be dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy33;Bow before me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy34;Sigmar might have ascended in the long past, after he left this world, but you are a god now, divine blood ruling over this lands. Why should you bow down to one who is your equal, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy34;The gods rule from afar, rarely ever talking to their followers, all the gods except you. Your worshippers can see you, they can hear your terrible voice and heed to your commands. Why should you bow down to those who are your equals, if not inferior to your might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy34;I am your Lord and Master!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35;What even is love? You do not remember any more, nor you feel any passion left for those who claim to love you in return. There's no point in keeping such a charade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35;I do not love you, nor anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy35005;So far has [From.GetFirstName] descended into madness that [From.GetSheHe] has entirely forgotten what it means to love and be loved. Now [From.GetSheHe] feels nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy35005;The one I loved is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36;All the anger, all the hatred, they're gone. In the past the mere name of this person would have inflamed your heart, but now, it is not even worth of your attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36;I have neither enemies nor friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy36005;[From.GetFirstName] has been your rival for a long time, but now the affliction plaguing [From.GetHerHis] mind has wiped away any of [From.GetHerHis] emotion towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy36005;I still don't like [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37;You've had friends in your life, but now the boundaries of camaraderie have been dissolved. You do not feel like you share anything with this person any more, nor the past experiences mean anything to you any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37;You are no longer my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy37005;There was a time when you enjoyed [From.GetFirstName]'s company, but now [From.GetSheHe] has grown cold and detached. There's no friendship or interest left within [From.GetHerHis] mind for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy37005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond14;With the death of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] the Druchii Sorceresses of Ghrond have elected another to lead their cabal: [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAsuccghrond3;The Sorceresses of Ghrond seem to be mostly approving of [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While not a certainty, [From.GetSheHe] may well be the next to rule over the cabal of Ghrond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond3;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsuccghrond4;The dreaded black tower of Ghrond has been home of Druchii Sorceresses for millennia. The old elven hags study magic and plot for power within its walls. It's unlikely for a Druchii to rule over them without their approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsuccghrond4;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1202;Are the creatures tearing reality and coming into your world, or are they a figment of your own imagination, created by the substances running through your veins? In either case, their mere sight is too horrifying to handle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1202;AAAAHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1203;When you lay down, your mind filled with the strangest stuff, you ponder over the mysteries of the universe. It is amazing what a new perspective can do to widen a person's mindset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1203;The music... of the universe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1204;A thousand enemies hide behind your very shadow. Every time you enhance your senses you can almost see them, lurking outside of reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsinsa1205;Taking a few spoonful of dust is just what you need to calm yourself and let all the worries of the world pass away as your mind is populated by the strangest things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1205;Hello, guys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1206;You must have more stuff, your reserves have been almost entirely depleted, but the supplier is having a hard time finding any new batch this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1206;I don't care how much it costs! Just find more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1206;The waiting is killing me!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1207;It has been sometime since beer and wine lost much of their appeal to you. They all taste stale and you cannot bear the headache coming after each drinking night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1207;I've better things to consume...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCschaos2;A servant comes running at you, screaming the ground has turned into a giant mouth and started taking bites off one of your buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESClustria9;The Lustrian Jungle has shifted violently in the early hours of the morning, utterly devouring one of your buildings. If we aren't careful more could be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAmagicpotential11;I don't care about these things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential11;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GHROND;Ghrond;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2;By decree of the Witch King, all women who show the potential for sorcery must turn themselves in so as to be properly trained in Ghrond, where they study the lore of dark magic in one of the six Covens founded by Morathi. They shall take no man nor bear any children and will live only to serve the Witch King as his spiritual brides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic2;I will relinquish my possessions and go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic2;No! I can still hide it... Keep on living like this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic2005;Your attempt at hiding your potential in magic could not go unnoticed forever to the eyes of Naggaroth. The servants of the Witch King have discovered your secret in the end and forced you to go to Ghrond, as it is your duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic20005;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic3;Since your daughter shows talent for magic, she has therefore been sent to Ghrond to study with the Covens of Morathi. This is a great honour for your house, as she will now become a bride of the Witch King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic3;A great honour indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic4;Another daughter of a noble house has been recognized as a potential apprentice and has been sent to Ghrond to receive proper teaching and become a Sorceress of the Covens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic4;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic5;The trials of Ghrond are harsh and unforgiving. Only the most gifted and cunning amongst the druchii summoned will manage to achieve mastery over the dark powers and claim their place as Sorceresses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic5;I must keep learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAdarkelfmagic6;You've spent years in the dark tower and all your hard work has finally paid off. You have taken your rightful place as a bride of the Witch King, a Sorceress of the Coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBdarkelfmagic6;Despite your best intentions, you have not managed to pass all the trials and the ruling hags of Ghrond have not deemed you worthy of taking place amongst them. Bound against your will, you shall be turned into a mindless servant, only employed to satiate the Witch King's lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6;So I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdarkelfmagic6;Gooooohhh...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6005;Your daughter has shown herself to be worthy of the title of Sorceress. She has taken her place within the Covens, bringing more honour to your great House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6005;Good for her. And for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdarkelfmagic6006;Your daughter has disgraced herself: she was not able to pass the final tests to become a proper Sorceress and has now been reduced to a worthless mindless slave in the Witch King's harem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdarkelfmagic6006;Disgusting child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HOETH;Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic2;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] thinks you show talent in magic and has signed you up to study with the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOTAhighelfmagic2;A great honour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic3;Every Apprentice in Hoeth has to dedicate himself to countless hours of study to assimilate the centuries of knowledge accumulated in the great libraries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic3;I'll do my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic4;The scion of a noble house shows talent for magic and has been sent to be taught amongst the Loremasters of Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic4;We will welcome this new apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhighelfmagic5;The your long years of study have finally paid off. You can feel the magic within you and have been officially recognized as a respected Asur Mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhighelfmagic5;Despite your efforts, Magic just doesn't seem the right path for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5;I will use these powers wisely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhighelfmagic5;I tried my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has achieved [From.GetHerHis] goal and graduated from Hoeth as an official Asur Mage, a prestigious accomplishment for [From.GetHerHim] and your House.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESChighelfmagic5006;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was unable to reach [From.GetHerHis] full potential and, after a series of mishaps, has been expelled from Hoeth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhighelfmagic5006;You're a disgrace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10001;A foul Sorcerer has come to your lands, claiming to have had visions of your future victories from the Gods. The wandering traveller is willing to settle in your court in exchange for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10001;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10002;A Shaman has come to your lands, gaining some favour amongst the locals. The soothsayer is willing to join your court and provide their services for a meagre price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10002;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10003;A mysterious visitor from the deserts has come to your court. Apparently he is a famous scholar from a faraway land, gifted in the arts of magic and he'd be willing to stay and offer his services to you for a meagre pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10003;You are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice10003;We have no such money to spare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice10004;A travelling Witch has decided to settle at your court. She has requested a few things for her stay, but there's no way of you to refusing her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10004;You... are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice2;Your guardian has the reputation of a powerful magician. And being in the company of such an individual has made you wondering if you could become a mage as well, when you grow up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice2;Can you teach me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has expressed a desire to learn magic from you as your apprentice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice3;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice3;Not a chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice4;You're taking too long. Perhaps you do not have the gift of magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice4;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice5;[From.GetFirstName] does not think you have what it takes to wield magic and has dismissed your request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice5;But I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice6;You've been delighted to know your [GetFromRelation] was quite happy to take you as [From.GetHerHis] apprentice and teach you in the ways of the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice6;Yes! I won't disappoint you, I promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice7;Teaching someone how to feel and channel the Winds of Magic is no easy task. What do you want [From.GetFirstName] to be taught?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice7;I'll teach [From.GetHerHim] about caution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice7;A mage must keep an open mind and experiment new things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice7;One cannot channel the arcane powers without focus and discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice7;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be cautious. Of how tricky and deceitful daemons are and of how so easily a spell can turn in a catastrophe fore everyone involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should be bold and inventing. Of how you shouldn't just learn from [From.GetHerHim], but search your own knowledge and create new ways of turning the Winds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70002;I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice70003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you of how a mage should never lose his calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70003;I'm trying to, really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it has all paid off: you can feel the magic inside you and call it through your will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice70004;You've spent years over dusty tomes and stinking potions under your [GetFromRelation]'s tutelage, but it was all for naught: you're no closer to casting the first cantrip as you were when you started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice70004;This is just the beginning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice70004;Why can't I do it?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice8;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has paid off: [From.GetSheHe] has started casting [From.GetHerHis] first spells without any help and is likely to go on [From.GetHerHis] studies without need of your tutelage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice8;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80005;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has succeeded in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is now a fully qualified mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80005;A great accomplishment for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80006;Your work with [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been in vain: [From.GetSheHe] doesn't appear able to call for the Winds of Magic and might as well have no power at all in [From.GetHerHis] blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80006;What a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice80007;It seems your [GetFromRelation] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] apprenticeship and is unlikely to ever become a mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice80007;What a loss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice9;The Winds of Chaos will favour only the chosen ones of the Gods. To prepare [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSheHe] must give in to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and his unholy worship and live by his tenets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice9;I will speak to [From.GetHerHim] of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice9;I will teach [From.GetHerHim] the tenets of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice9;All the same, [From.GetSheHe] needs to learn of incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice9;I feel the Gods will soon test [From.GetHerHis] resolve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Changer of Ways and of how he could grant you infinite powers beyond your imagination, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and embrace him as your only Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Lord of the Flies and of how his warm embrace could grant you great powers and a safe haven from pain and death, if only you were to forsake the faith of your ancestors and love him back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending quite a lot of time talking about someone called the Dark Prince and how he could make you feel better than you ever did in your entire life and show you marvels beyond your comprehension, if only you were to relinquish the faith of your ancestors and bow to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90001;Seems a good bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice90001;No, I don't like him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted of how only Tzeentch can lead [From.GetHerHim] to the true mastery over the Winds of Magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally understood and welcomed the unconditioned love of Papa Nurgle in [From.GetHerHis] heart, hoping to receive his gift in return soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90002;[From.GetFirstName] has finally felt Slaanesh's touch and yearns for more, aware of the uncharted heights of pleasure [From.GetSheHe] has still to reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90002;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still stubbornly refusing to accept Tzeentch as [From.GetHerHis] new Master. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] does not understand how only the uncontested Lord of Magic could grant [From.GetHerHim] the power you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still rudely rejecting Nurgle's love. The Lord of the Flies is magnanimous and will keep bestowing his gifts, as will you, hoping in a change of heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90003;[From.GetFirstName] is still squeamish about the delights Slaanesh and you are presenting to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90003;Everyone comes around, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to sleep after all your [GetFromRelation] warns you about everyday. Everyone is everyone's enemy. Power can be gained only through deceit and a cunning mind. You will only ever manage to learn magic from [From.GetHerHim] by stealing [From.GetHerHis] knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90004;It was a little disconcerting at starts, but having to not worry about cuts and illness is such a relief. Your [GetFromRelation]'s god is truly a kind and generous Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90004;It's hard to understand half of the things your [GetFromRelation] tells and does to you, but you've started to gain more and more curiosity as you experienced the delights offered by the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90004;But what about spells?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice90005;[From.GetFirstName] has finally decided to spare some time to teach you about mustering control over the Winds of Chaos. Most of it is still gibberish to you, but you cannot do much about it, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90005;What does this mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90007;The Changer of Ways has seen fit to bless your pupil with power over reality, as you knew he would. Your [GetFromRelation] is set up on a path to greatness. In fact, maybe you were to generous to the little brat. What if [From.GetSheHe] becomes a threat to your plans, now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90007;Grandfather Nurgle has bestowed a most precious gift upon your apprentice, allowing [From.GetHerHim] to finally have full control over the Winds of Chaos. Soon, your young new friends will share the love of the Lord of the Flies to many more unwilling people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90007;The Serpent is pleased with you and your pupil and has seen fit to grant [From.GetHerHim] a speck of his power to let [From.GetHerHis] fantasies grow wilder still.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90007;Success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice90008;The plans of Tzeentch go beyond the comprehension of the rabble. Evidently your [GetFromRelation] was not gifted enough and when the Changer of Ways touched [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetHerHis] body and mind could not bear his awesome power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice90008;Sadly, for once, Papa Nurgle might have been a little too generous: your [GetFromRelation] has collapsed beneath his many gifts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice90008;Your [GetFromRelation] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self a failure. Your pupil just doesn't seem to have enough imagination for you or your Dark Prince's tastes, despite [From.GetHerHis] many despertate efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice90008;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice10;A rush of power goes through your body each time you invoke one of Tzeentch's names, the Winds of Magic ready to bow to your every whim and warp reality at a mere gesture of your hands. Truly, your long years of study with [From.GetFirstName] have paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice10;Many gifts has Grandfather Nurgle bestowed upon you, but it finally came the time for magic to be amongst them. There so much you feel you can do right now and the Lord of the Flies is certain to give you all the time you could wish for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice10;Magic has finally come to you and you could barely spend any time sleeping in the past week: so much to experiment, so much to change and cut and sew with invisible fingers and unearthly precision. The Serpent has given you his greatest tool to express your art across the entire world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice10;Finally! Power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice11;Graboliwayghsggrksukaeàfakjcsahxbghhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice11;Papa Nurgle has blessed you just too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsorcererapprentice11;Slaanesh is still unimpressed with you. It looks like you've lost his interest and won't become a mage any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice11;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15009;As an ancient King of Nehekhara, the power of the dead is already entwined within your very essence.

EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15014;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted your terms and abandoned [From.GetHerHis] failed gods to follow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15014;Good... Let me educate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15015;[From.GetFirstName] has refused your terms, preferring to cling to [From.GetHerHis] failed gods rather than learn the secrets of eternal life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15015;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15016;[From.GetFirstName] has considered your request and decided to assist you, with no request on [From.GetHerHis] part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15016;A great gift, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15017;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted to help you, but only if you first allow [From.GetHerHim] to bestow upon you the dark gift. As it stands, [From.GetFirstName] assures you your studies will be much easier once you've become an immortal undead as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15017;A great opportunity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice15017;I wish to control the dead, not be one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15018;Your [GetFromRelation] has accepted your terms and allowed you in [From.GetHerHis] chambers so that you could give [From.GetHerHim] the dark kiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15019;Your [GetFromRelation] has stubbornly refused your gift, still too attached to [From.GetHerHis] fleeting life to see the wisdom in your offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15019;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice15020;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] has not considered you worthy of receiving [From.GetHerHis] ancient knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice15020;On my own, then. As usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice16;It's been hard trying to figure it all out with no materials, no school, no master, but you've made it, you're finally a necromancer. Through your will, the dead can walk and speak once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice16;You've tried your best, but without a guide you're just running blind. There's no way you'll ever learn the secrets of undeath this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice16;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice16;Damnation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice17;Your [GetFromRelation] has approached you, offering [From.GetHerHis] knowledge of the dark arts. For some reason [From.GetSheHe] believes you might become a powerful necromancer under [From.GetHerHis] guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice17;Sounds intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice17;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice18;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has rejected your offer of power over death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice18;The fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19;Teaching necromancy is no easy task. There are many dangers waiting in the art of summoning the spirits of the dead and sparking a semblance of life within corpses. What should you have your apprentice focus their attention on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19;Caution is what's really important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19;Daring is what a necromancer needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsorcererapprentice19;Focus above everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsorcererapprentice19;It is time to test [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19001;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be cautious. One should never be taken by surprise by how easily a spirit could break its chains or an horde lose its purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19001;I'll try and be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19002;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should be bold and daring. You must harden yourself to the horrors you'll witness and never hesitate in your choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19002;I will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice19003;Your [GetFromRelation] is spending a lot of time teaching you how a necromancer should always remain calm and maintain absolute discipline at all times, for it is a vital component for casting even the simplest spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19003;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsorcererapprentice19004;You've succeeded, you can feel the dark power flowing through your veins, compelling the dead to listen to your commands. You are a necromancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsorcererapprentice19004;Despite your best efforts, it seems necromancy is not the right thing for you. Your many years of study qualified you only for graverobbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice19004;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsorcererapprentice19004;Damnations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has exceeded your expectations. Under [From.GetHerHis] will, the dead walk again. Your work is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20005;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has taken a dark path and mastered the art of necromancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20005;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20006;[From.GetFirstName] revealed [From.GetHerHim]self to be a failure. Despite your efforts, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem capable of mastering the dark arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20006;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsorcererapprentice20007;It would seem your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]'s attempts at mastering the art of Necromancy ended in failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsorcererapprentice20007;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# DEMON EVENTS

EVTDESCsdemons1;As the executioner approaches, the daemon spits a curse in the dark tongue and disappears in a flash, leaving no trace behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons1;Hopefully the headman's axe scared it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons2;No cell can hold a creature of the warp. A few words and reality bends to facilitate your escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons2;Free again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons3;There are so many mortals to play with. So sad they are so easy to break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons3;There's more where this came from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons4;You've rallied an experienced group of hunters, hoping they will manage to track and destroy the evil creature infesting your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons4;Go forth and bring me its head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40001;The hunters have returned to you with the head of the wretched daemon. Your realm is finally free of its evil presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40001;Rejoice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons40002;The hunters tried their best, but the daemon eluded their traps. It left only their mangled remains as a warning against future attempts to eliminate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons40002;Hmm... hopefully we have reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons5;The minds of the mortals are easy to manipulate and you take a special delight in pitting those clueless fools one against the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons5;Yeah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons50001;Sometimes you cannot just stand the sight of your friends and colleagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons50001;I hate you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons6;There are so many people waiting to receive the gifts of the Lord of the Flies. And you have plenty to give yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons6;Gloorrrgh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons60001;You've been feeling rather sick, when suddenly horrible rashes and boils erupt from your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons60001;Gh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons7;The mortals entangled themselves so beautifully with lust and lies. It takes only a little nudge to let the shroud unravel in a wondrous cascade of passion and violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons7;Glamorous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons70001;Each night you dream of your spouse in bed with someone else. Last night, you could see their faces, you are certain now this is no dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons70001;How could you!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdemons8;Isn't it wondrous to roam free in the lands to spread Chaos wherever and whenever you please?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdemons8;It sure is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# LUNACY EVENTS
#
EVTDESCslunacy40;You thought you could live with it, but never growing old, never being an adult has turned your unlife into a curse. Are you even meant to think these things? You are still a child, after all. You will always be a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy40;I want new toys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy41;Nothing, nothing excites you any longer. Your vampiric senses allow you to perceive any smell, any touch to its fullest, but you've satiated yourself with all the world had to offer to you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy41;No! There must be something more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy42;All the people you care about grow old and die, the world has changed into a foreign and distasteful place, yet you're still the same, a relic of a past long gone, without any real purpose left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy42;Why do anything at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43;It's a warm day and, even in your palace, you feel uncomfortable. You long for the cold embrace of your dear mother. Once you approach her to ask for some hours of cuddling, you also realize you feel somewhat hungry and your eyes fall eerily on her breasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy43;It's a warm day and, even in your palace, you feel uncomfortable. You long for the cold embrace of your dear mother. That is, if you add a proper one. Just like you, she's never grown old, to the point you have started doubting if she's your mother at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43;Hug me, mommy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43005;Your spawn, trapped in a childish body and devolved into a childish mind has come to you today, asking for some affection. As [From.GetSheHe] throws [From.GetHerHim]self on you, [From.GetHerHis] fangs already try and find a way towards your chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy43005;Today your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has come crying to you, saying you're not [From.GetHerHis] real mother, but rather a deceitful girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43005;Oh, alright then... But just this once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy43005;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslunacy43005;No, you're the only child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43006;Your mother spends almost the whole day rocking you on her lap, allowing you to suckle milk and blood from her breast until satiated. When you finally fall asleep, she carries you back to your coffin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy43006;Your mother spends almost the whole day rocking you on her lap, allowing you to suckle milk and blood from her breast until satiated. When you finally fall asleep, she carries you back to your coffin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43006;And now you'll be my mum forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy43006;We should do this more often, mum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43007;Your mother refused your request, scolding you with some nonsense about being too old for what you asked for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43007;But mum!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy43008;You grab your child's hair, mocking [From.GetHerHim] for crying and starting to gleefully let [From.GetHerHim] chase you. You turn into fog, call for wolves to catch each other's scent, have undead fight for your wounded honor and finally and happily fall asleep together as the dawn approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy43008;Best time ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44;It was already hard being with an eternal child, but recently your love has started to act more and more like one. You do not know how should you feel about your partner or how should you be together from further on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy44;It was already hard being with an eternal child, but recently your love has started to act more and more like one. It was a fun quirk at the beginning, like a proper aristocrat develops in its long life, but now it grow into an embarassement of sorts. You do not know how should you feel about your partner or how should you be together from further on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44;I can't love a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy44;This was never about love anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslunacy44;Actually, this is kind of intriguing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. When pressured, [From.GetFirstName] admitted that [From.GetSheHe] cannot love a child like you appear to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslunacy44001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. When pressured, [From.GetFirstName] admitted that your child-like behaviour embarrasses [From.GetHerHim] and doesn't want to have anything to do with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44001;Fine! I don't want your cooties anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been acting strangely lately, avoiding you all the time. Not that you really care about a grown-up like [From.GetHerHim], but it is annoying to not having [From.GetHerHim] around when you need [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44002;I'm hungry! Fetch me someone to drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslunacy44003;You felt a little weird when your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] shared bed with you today after so long. You weren't sure about it, but some of the funny things [From.GetSheHe] did with you were quite pleasing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy44003;Do we do it again tomorrow?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy45;The more you try new things to stimulate your senses, the more you grow accustomed to excesses and depravities. You have grown to have quite the reputation amongst your fellow aristocrats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy45;Who cares? I want more! I can barely feel anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46;Your skin feels cold and stale, your mind is feverish for the need of new sensations. What can you do to appease your desire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46;Cut the flesh, bring the pain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy46;Feeding on life, what else could be more exilerating?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslunacy46;I need someone to sate this desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslunacy46;Anything! Just... just anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46001;What does it matter how deep you cut with your nails and fangs? You can already see your wounds healing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46001;It's useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46002;You feed and feed upon a dozen or so different victims, some provided by the servants, some willingly submitting to your grasp. But even after you're wallowed in their blood, you feel nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46002;More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46003;Blood is not enough to placate your desire, so you start taking pieces of meat from your victims as well, gorging on the flesh of the living against all your instincts. The repulsion you feel is dim, but at least it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46003;More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46004;There's always some young thrall around, too young to have dignity, too eager to rise to care about shame, but ravaging their body gives you no pleasure. There is no itch, not the way the mortals feel, not way some of the other aristocrats claim to feel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46004;Why can't I feel it!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46005;You needed something different from another cold body to rub over yours, but the warmth of the servant you pinned on your bed does not make you feel any passion, just a mild annoying thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46005;Always thirst, I hate it! Can't I feel ANYTHING ELSE!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy46006;A mortal is just some cattle, a vampire another cold body without any passion in it. You thought a ghoul would be the middle ground where you could find a little excitement, but the pitiful creature is nothing but cattle with a worse stench.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy46006;Grrrmmnhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47007;Nobody understand what you need to feel anything, nobody knows how empty you are. You thought commanding an undead would give you something new and something that could push exactly as far as you ordered. But the shambling rotting body has no fire within it, all the actions you order it to take resonate hollow within your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47007;Useless sack of bones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47008;You dance around the shadow, looking at the first burns, then daring your eyes up in the clean sky. The rush of fear and repulsion runs through your body, shrieking for you to hide inside, but you move another step forward, inebriated by that terror and the smell of your own flesh burning under the sunlight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47008;Ahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47009;The chains twist your limbs, while the hooks slowly tear out pieces of your flesh. Soon, the wounds will close and then the pain will go away, allowing that new sensation to come about, the weird feeling of having healed parts dislocated from their correct position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47009;Ahhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47010;The twin-tailed comet, the hammer of Sigmar, looking at them feels you with fear and just for that you feel compelled to go against your instincts and place your hands on the holy symbols, reveling on the pain and revulsion summoned by Nagash's curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47010;I can almost feel him chant the spell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy47011;You take your arm out of the river, noting how the running water withered and corroded your perfect pale flesh. It is an intriguing sensation, one mortals could not describe. It is not like being burned, but it has a similar effect. As you watch your exposed bones, you immerse the arm once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy47011;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy48;There is nothing and no-one for you to live for anymore. And yet, you remain in this eternal life, condemned to live until after the end of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy48;Why can't I die?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49;There was a time when you were a greater person. When your servants knew how to properly respect their betters, when you could dream of conquests and exquisite endeavors. Yet it is all gone, your life now but a hollow memory of what it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49;The past... is all I have left...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49001;You feel like the world holds no interest for you anymore. You have no longer place in it and thus, you slowly fall into hibernation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49001;I'll dream of what was...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslunacy49005;You suddenly feel something, as if the unlife as unmoving corpse could be worst of what you left, however little it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslunacy49005;It is time to wake! I am back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslunacy49005;No... no... I will sleep, for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCGhuntdown2;You've reached the great piramid of your target, the ancient Slann. The creature is likely sleeping within, but there is no telling what traps and spells it has wrapped around the building. Or how many Skinks are guarding it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHhuntdown2;You've reached the dark cove of the ancient vampire you hunt for. The green moon is clouded and only a few stars glitter the nightsky. Perhaps this might not be the right moment to push forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIhuntdown2;You've reached the gloomy palace of the vampire you seek to destroy. It is a clouded night and you can hear the crackling sound of the undead's bones in the courtyard. How should you proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2;My magic shall protect us and lead inside undetected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhuntdown2;We wait for dawn. Then sneak in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTChuntdown2;We sneak in, checking for traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDhuntdown2;Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2001;Intruders have been found sneaking inside your very lair. They're attempt to pass unnoticed has failed, but they're still pushing forward, likely to reach your room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2001;I shall unleash fire and death upon them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBhuntdown2001;I must find a safe place from the sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBhuntdown2002;Go forth, my minions, slaughter the intruders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2101;[From.GetFirstName] has unleashed [From.GetHerHis] deadly power and burned you and your companions to a crisp. Your quest ends here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2101;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2999;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was not up to the challenge, it seems. You've received news of [From.GetHerHis] death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2999;I'll have to wait for another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2102;[From.GetFirstName] has unleashed [From.GetHerHis] deadly power to try and burn you and your companions alive. You've barely survived, but not without grievous injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2102;Hnnnmpf..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2103;The hellhounds of the Daemon Prince are after your squad, yelling and growling, their echoes reverbering on the metallic walls of the sanctuary. You can see the Daemon awaiting, swords at hand, on its throne, but you must get through its minions first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBhuntdown2103;Nurglings crawls all over your bodies, trying to sink their infective teeth in your flesh, as you slowly advance in the miasmic swamp. It is only after a while you realize the hill ahead of you is really the Daemon Prince of Nurgle, awaiting to embrace you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCChuntdown2103;Demented sycophants hurl themselves at you, piercing and pulling your skin with hooks and chains. You've slowly made your way through the labyrintine palace, but have yet to reach the depraved servant of Slaanesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDhuntdown2103;The very floor and walls shift at your steps, trying to grab and cut you and your followers in pieces. You feel you're closer to the center of madness, the Daemon Prince of Tzeentch, but have yet to pierce through its spells and illusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCFhuntdown2103;The forest has risen against you. Dryads and saplings slow your advance towards the Spirit's glade, while hidden Asrai target you from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGhuntdown2103;Every step upwards a new trap triggers, a new spell falls down upon your men, cutting down your numbers. Yet, your evermore closer to the top, where the Slann awaits in sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHhuntdown2103;The hordes of ghouls and other undead monstrosities are blocking your path downards, but you still keep fighting through, knowing every fallen rotten corpse is a step closer to your quarry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIhuntdown2103;The enthralled guards and undead minions of the vampire have come to block your way. You must fight your way through the palace to reach your quarry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown2103;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown2104;Your rush towards your target has not been successfull. You're the last to fall. When you awake, your corpse has been thrown outside. Albeith you've risen again, your mission has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAhuntdown2201;Face me, creature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown3001;The Chaos God of War and Violence will have another reason to distaste magic today. Thanks to your spells, you've managed to foil the outer defences of the Daemon Prince and appeared right in its sanctum, before it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAhuntdown4002;With an explosion of blood and splinters the Daemon Prince of Khorne is finally destroyed.

EVTDESCBhuntdown4002;Cut from a thousand wounds, the bloated body of the Nurglite Prince starts flushing out a torrent of pus and mucus, slowly crumbling on itself.

EVTDESCGhuntdown4002;With one final whimper, the Slann splatters on the walls of the piramid, thorn apart by the Winds of Magic in its final attempt to defend itself from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHhuntdown4002;The monstrous vampire falls back, trying to flee in a cloud of fog, deadly injured by your fighters, but you're quicker than the creature and manage to stop it by stabbing its heart. Now immobilized, the vampire is easily disposed of by the rest of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAhuntdown4100;The adventurers who infiltrated your lair have cornered you. You fight savagely against them, but it is of no avail. In the end, their leader gives the final strike which kills you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAhuntdown4100;Naaaannhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAhuntdown4101;The adventurers who infiltrated your lair finally come to face you directly, they are fierce, but they could do nothing against a creature such as yourself and are obliterated one by one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# MAGIC POTENTIAL EVENTS
#
EVTDESCmagicpotential2;Since your childhood strange things have kept happening around you. You can't quite put your finger on it, it's nothing concrete, just a vague sensation of weirdness ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBmagicpotential2;Maybe.. Maybe I shouldn't talk about this;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDmagicpotential6005;A [From.GetBoyGirl]? It must not be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential12;In your travels and experiments, you've found traces of unsanctioned magic being performed in this land.

EVTOPTAmagicpotential12006;Burn him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBmagicpotential12006;Neutralize this man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotential12008;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled against your favour: the Ice Witches apprehend you and use their spells to permanently sever you from the Winds of Magic. Men where never meant to wield these powers, for your insolence you will lose much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential12009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled in your favour, yet your existence is a threat to pristine flow of Ice magic or so Ice Witches think - you won't be forgotten...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotential13;Your studies have been recently disturbed by waves of unknown magic. You've followed the interferences to what appears to be an unsanctioned female scholar. Women are forbidden to read and study magic, as the Prophets teach they more easily fall to the corruption of the undead. It is your duty to apprehend this traitor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAmagicpotential13;I'll confront her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotential13009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled in your favour. It seems the Scholar will leave you alone, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialA3;As time passes, you still feel the twinging of magic, it's very distant, probably you wouldn't understand what it was if your people didn't know so much about it, but it's still there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialB3;As time passes, you still feel the twinging of magic, it's very distant, probably you wouldn't understand what it was if your people didn't know so much about it, but it's still there.

EVTDESCmagicpotentialC3;As time passes, it seems clear now you are clearly a wizard in the making: since your childhood you've felt the Winds of Magic and instinctively tried to influence their flow. If only you found a teacher;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCmagicpotentialD3;When your eyes are closed you can still see the Winds of Magic flowing through the world. Such is your potential in magic that you've already managed to warp reality through your will a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAmagicpotential3005;Something to ponder about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAmagicpotential4;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCmagicpotentialD6005;How could it have passed unnoticed for all these years? Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has clearly a strong connection to the Winds of Magic. So strong could [From.GetHerHis] powers grow, if left unchecked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ring_of_power_meme_desc;Powerful ring. Once forged in secret at the forges of Nagashizzar by the Dark lord and "imbued" with most of their own power says the legends... by smeagob himself;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsrandoms1001;Gud ladz!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms1002;Disconcerting news from the South: a great tide of greenskins has swept through many of the northern provinces of the Southlands. The victories have increased the momentum of the goblin raiders, whose ranks keep growing every day. If they're not stopped quickly, they drown all of the human realms of Greater Araby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms1002;Something must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2;Sudenburg's Corruption;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2;For too long Sudenburg has lingered at the edge of the abyss, indolently sliding towards the pit of corruption under the perverted lead of decadent rulers. This once mighty city was built on the very ashes of the heathens burned by the first Knight-Captain to reach Araby, only another great cleansing can save it from eternal damnation.\n You couldn't have come at worst time, if your own predecessor, a Templar of Sigmar, had been corrupted by the vile undead lurking the swamps of Aruk, then anyone could be compromised. As you run through the reports of your Brother-Knights, your main concern is the despicable friendliness the Graf of Sudenburg seems to share with his neighbors of Olohrad. If the ruler Sudenburg openly intermingles with this heathens, is it any surprise his subjects feel so encouraged to walk into the lures of the undead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2;I will investigate on the Graf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2;I will investigate on Olohrad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsrandoms2;I will focus on something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2001;The Graf's Son;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2001;Heathens as they were, the Bretonnian Crusaders at least knew how to face the repulsive lures of witches and warlocks. Not only has Graf Marcellus maintained friendly relationships with the Akghans of Olohrad and the fanatic slavers of Al-Anaim, he has given his own and only son Timo as a husband to the daughter of the Bunda King. \n You are fairly certain the barbarian wife has charmed the heir of Sudenburg in some way. If he's allowed to succeed his father, it could be seen as further encouragement for the peasants to mix the races and acquire the wicked customs of the Southlanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2001;It must not be. He must be disposed of, at any cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2001;He's still the Graf's son. I'll look for some other way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TITLEsrandoms2002;The Witch-Doctors of Olohrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2002;You've spent some time in Olohrad under cover, but your investigation has given you more doubts than clarity. The people of Olohrad seem to believe they are the only defenders against the darkness coming from the South, as if, by using the despicable sorcery of the undead, they were fighting them.\n Such is the hypocricy of sinners. Nevertheless, the Akghani witch-doctors might be a useful source of information against your main foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2002;Maybe I can learn something;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2002;The very thought is sinful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms2004;You've the chance to talk with [From.GetTitledFirstName] a few times now. You've often doubted [From.GetHerHis] word, believing [From.GetSheHe] was just patronizing you for half the time, possibly seeing through your disguise. Yet, [From.GetSheHe] has proven useful in better understanding the nature of your undead enemies. As misguided as they can be, these witch-doctors have allegedly been fighting the vampires of the Southlands for centuries, it would be unwise to squander their knowledge on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms2004;No, I will not be tempted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms2004;I suppose I can use them, for the moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms3001;[From.GetFirstName] has been disposed of and you can rest easier. With his death, you hope the Graf will be forced to distance himself from Olohrad and the other decadent city-states, restricting trade deals and tightening the borders. All of this will make easier for you to investigate in Sudenburg itself and will help the city in the long term to maintain its identity and purity of faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms3001;Sigmar willing, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsrandoms4;Since your birth, a ravenous hunger has filled your mind and cramped your belly. As you are growing, this unending urge seems to be growing even further, regardless of how much you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsrandoms4;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsrandoms4;No! I'm sick of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
