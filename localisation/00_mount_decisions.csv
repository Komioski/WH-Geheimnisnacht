warbear_mount;Ursun War Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warbear_mount_desc;There is no creature more important to the Kislevites than the bear. He is more than just the symbol of the land, a god, and his image is more than just a rallying figure for armies and proud citizens. The bear shares his life with the people of the oblast and shares their struggles. When winters are harsh, he goes hungry just as they do. When spring comes again, he takes his young to the river to play just as they do. In summers bloom, he trains his young to hunt, and he hunts as well as any man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

They are found in many places but are most commonly seen on the continent known as the New World that lies just to the west of Ulthuan.

Giant spiders can be part of a larger brood, often led by a spider queen, but they are often encountered singly or in small numbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mammoth_mount;Mammoth Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;x
