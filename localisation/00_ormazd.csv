become_ormazd_caliph;Restore the Califate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_ormazd_caliph_desc;Since the fall of Calif Jaffar, Araby has collapsed into infighting and the Ormazdic faith has no rightful head. A ruler powerful enough and with the right bloodline could claim the title of Calif-al-Umma, rightful Sultan of All Araby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ormazdian4a;Long live the Calif!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian4b;I will never bow my head to this pretender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian0desc;DEBUG: This hidden event adds Sayyid/Mirza upon birth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian1desc;DEBUG: This hidden event adds non-Sayyid/non-Mirza traits and vice versa upon conversion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian4desc;After his successful war against [FromFrom.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName] has declared [From.GetReflexivePronoun] Calif-al-Umma - the spiritual leader of all Ormazdics. Only the Kitabids, a sect denying the right of any single [From.GetManWoman] to rule all Ormazdics, stand against [From.GetHerHim]. As a [Root.GetTitle] of Araby, you stand at a crossroads: do you acknowledge [From.GetHerHim] and risk becoming a mere servant, or will you deny [From.GetHerHis] right to rule by joining the Kitabid sect and risk the wrath of [From.GetHerHis] followers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian5desc;[Root.RelHead] has declared himself Calif-al-Umma - spiritual leader of all Ormazdics. Your liege, [From.GetBestName], has chosen to acknowledge [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] authority. Do you do so as well, or will you join the Kitabids, who deny the right of anyone to lead all Ormazdics?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian6desc;[Root.RelHead] has declared himself Calif-al-Umma - spiritual leader of all Ormazdics. Your liege, [From.GetBestName], has chosen to resist [Root.RelHead.GetHerHim] authority by joining the Kitabids, who deny the right of anyone to lead all Ormazdics. Will you do so as well, or do you dare to stand against your [From.GetLordLady]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian3name;Rise of the Ormazdic Califate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian3desc;Since the days of Mulhaed al-Quyat, the Calif-al-Umma has been the spiritual leader of all faithful Ormazdics. The real power of the Calif has waxed and waned over the centuries: at times, he could rightly call himself Sultan of All Araby. At other times, he was but a mere figurehead for a more powerful ruler.\nHowever, the disastrous reign of the last Calif of All Araby, Jaffar, and the Bretonnian occupation after the Crusades, shattered the prestige of the Calif and splintered Araby into many princedoms. Since then, no-one has dared call himself Calif. Now, a young preacher has gathered an army of insolent peasants around himself and calls himself Calif. Should his rightful liege be unable to suppress the revolt, Ormazdics everywhere could be lead to acknowledge his authority. As long as there is no rightful Calif, the danger of such an uprising will persist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ormazdian3optb;Pretender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian3optc;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian7desc;Only a Sayyid may call himself Calif-al-Umma. Unless you have a relative or courtier who can claim this status, the line of Ormudzan Califs will now die out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ormazdian9desc;The last of the Arabyan Califs has died. With no other descendant of the Prophet Mulhaed al-Quyat in a position to inherit the title, the Ormuzdan faith is now once again leaderless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
