hide_deformity_spells_desc;Employ the Winds of Magic to remove whatever is tarnishing your beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure90;For too long this deformity has disturbed your gracious looks. Once the proper rituals have been completed, you feel the Winds of Magic shrouding the touch of Chaos, leaving your body to look clean and pure as it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure90;Calling upon the Winds of Magic you weave the proper incantations to refill the gaps and cuts filling your face, shrouding the disfigurement which plagues it and leaving your skin again as a pristine surface.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure90;You can no longer stand to move around in a bloated formless body, luckily dark magic offers an easy solution and with a few gestures and words, you can sport once again nimble and tight limbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure90;You've grown tired of the pale and hollow look on your face and of your bones sticking out under your skin, luckily magic has many uses and, with a proper spell, you can show once more a healthy appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure90;Finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation reshaping your appearance is falling apart, showing once more the consequences of your indulgence on your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation reshaping your appearance is falling apart, showing once more the consequences of your deprivation on your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation reshaping your appearance is falling apart, showing the disgusting disfigurement spoiling your features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation hiding the mark of Chaos on your flesh is falling apart and cruel spines sprout once more from your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation hiding the mark of Chaos on your flesh is falling apart and twisted horns sprout once more from your forehead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation hiding the mark of Chaos on your flesh is falling apart and sharp scales cut their way over your skin once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation hiding the mark of Chaos on your flesh is falling apart and the third eye opens again on your forehead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation hiding the mark of Chaos on your flesh is falling apart, you frantically try to speak as the long blackened tongue sprouts once more from your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIspleasure91;Something must have backfired in your spell. The woven incantation hiding the mark of Chaos on your flesh is falling apart and rough crests sprout once more to cover your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure91;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure94;You've chosen to focus your delightful attention unto your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. What do you think would you be best to improve [From.GetHerHis] character?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure94;I don't like how [From.GetSheHe] looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure94;I don't like how [From.GetSheHe] behaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure94;I've changed my mind, [From.GetSheHe] bores me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] is certainly a champion in excess and indulgence. There's little [From.GetSheHe] won't try for the sake of pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] is no stranger to the sublime search for pleasure, taking risks and frequently trying to reach new forms of excess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure97;It can be argued [From.GetFirstName] has a few interesting quirks, but [From.GetSheHe] overall sports a dull character, still too shy to experience true pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] has to be one of the dullest persons in the world. Exceeding neither in vice nor in virtue, [From.GetSheHe] might certainly be in need for some improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] is not known for any specific virtue, but [From.GetSheHe] appears to have no experience in the delights of excess, either. This seems to be little short of an average person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] has certainly a reputation for intransigent behaviour and a prudish attitude. Someone really in need of dedicated attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] is a pure and kind soul, dull and prudish, unable to understand the joys of real life. It will take a lot of effort to pierce [From.GetHerHis] stuck up attitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure97;[From.GetFirstName] has such a plain and transparent reputation, it almost fascinates, in a way. This has to be one of the purest creatures in the entire world, well worthy of some retouching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure97;*Flatter [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure97;*Shame [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure97;*Bash [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure97;*Tempt [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure97;*Trick [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure97;*Traumatize [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure98;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has spent a lot of time in the past days praising your good looks, claiming your features are falling just short of perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure98;Of course, that's how it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure98;I think you're overstating things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure98001;You could hardly believe what your heard when [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] questioned your appearance openly. Now it looks like it won't even be the last time [From.GetSheHe] spouts shrouded insults to your looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure98001;I cannot deny it, [From.GetSheHe]'s right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure98001;How dare [From.GetSheHe]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure98002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] just summoned you and spent a good hour reprimanding you publicly, yelling your appearance is disgraceful and that you must do something to improve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure98002;Yes, I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure98002;I don't like your tone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure98003;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] approached you in the last days, speaking about shared interests, but the more you are with [From.GetHerHim] the more [From.GetSheHe] seems to diverge to some unpleasant topics, as if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to encourage you to delve into such repulsive thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure98003;A little experimentation couldn't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure98003;That's disgusting. Keep it to yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure98004;You're not sure what your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is up to, but in the last days there have been some strange rumours running in the court, with people asking you strange questions about unclean business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure98004;Tell me more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure98004;I... have nothing to say on those matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure98005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] caught you completely off guard in the night, hiding inside your chambers and springing out when you were about to sleep. You can barely think of what [From.GetSheHe] tried to do, it was so obscene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure98005;I'll do anything, just stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure98005;Wh-?! Get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be responsive to your flattery and, even better, [From.GetSheHe] has shown to accept there might be room for improvement on [From.GetHerHis] looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] did not care much for flattery, keeping a humble and detached demeanour and giving no importance to the suggestions to improve [From.GetHerHis] looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure99;You're just too plain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure99;You're just too thin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure99;You're just too fat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] seems to be finally aware of [From.GetHerHis] terrible state, thanks to your sharp comments and allusions made within [From.GetHerHis] earshot. More to the point, [From.GetSheHe] seems to be open to attempt some improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] stubbornly refuses to listen to your precious suggestions about [From.GetHerHis] looks, regardless of how shameful you depict [From.GetHerHis] situation as.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure99001;You're just too plain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure99001;You're just too thin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure99001;You're just too fat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99002;Your scolding did good to [From.GetFirstName], [From.GetSheHe] finally understands how pitiful [From.GetHerHis] state is and seems eager to improve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99002;You tried to bash your [GetFromRelation], but [From.GetFirstName] shamelessly rebuked your insults, ignoring all the valid points against [From.GetHerHis] looks you made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure99002;You're just too plain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure99002;You're just too thin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure99002;You're just too fat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99003;Your delicately hinted ideas seems to have picked your [GetFromRelation]'s interest. Maybe now [From.GetFirstName] will like to know more. And try more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99003;You tried as you could to inspire your [GetFromRelation], but [From.GetSheHe] seems still impervious to your delicious suggestions. For the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure99003;You're too much of a prude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure99003;You're too modest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure99003;You're too serious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99004;Your intricate lies and manipulations caught [From.GetFirstName]'s attentions, [From.GetSheHe] appears eager to learn more of what is to be experienced in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99004;[From.GetFirstName] was deaf to your subtle attempts to inflame [From.GetHerHis] imagination, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't really seem to care at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure99004;You're too much of a prude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure99004;You're too modest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure99004;You're too serious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure99005;The direct approach is always the more effective. A little visit in your [GetFromRelation]'s chambers was enough to get [From.GetHerHis] full attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure99005;Strangely enough, [From.GetFirstName] did not answer well to you hiding inside [From.GetHerHis] chambers to give [From.GetHerHim] a taste of what [From.GetSheHe]'s missing. Yet, you're still determined to show [From.GetHerHim] the light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure99005;You're too much of a prude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure99005;You're too modest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure99005;You're too serious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. You cannot fail to deny [From.GetHerHis] objections and suggestions to improve your features. You had thought you had already reached perfection by this point, but there really is always more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. Indeed, [From.GetSheHe] does make a compelling case over the imperfection of some of your features, maybe [From.GetSheHe] should be listened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. Indeed, [From.GetSheHe] does make a compelling case over the imperfection of some of your features, although you feel like some of the changes [From.GetSheHe] hinted at might be a little... extreme...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has pestered you on about how important is your appearance and how you should groom it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has pestered you on about how important is your appearance and how you should groom it, ignoring all your requests to leave you alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has pestered you on about how important is your appearance and how you should groom it, ignoring every time you explained [From.GetHerHim] how little you care about this topic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has pestered you on about how important is your appearance and how you should groom it, despite the fact you made crystal clear you consider appearances meaningless compared to character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure100;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your looks. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has bragged on some nonsense regarding the importance of one's appearance. You can barely even understand why [From.GetSheHe] gives so much thought to something so meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure100;There might be truth in what you say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure100;No, this is nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has finally come to accept the research for beauty as the healthy obsession a proper person should groom. Your [GetFromRelation] can spend days locked inside [From.GetHerHis] rooms, looking at [From.GetHerHis] reflection, trying to spot any imperfections, trimming and combing hair, changing clothes, asking for advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to act properly, surrounding [From.GetHerHim]self with servants and maids to advise [From.GetHerHis] looks, constantly wondering what could improve [From.GetHerHis] features. Indeed, [From.GetSheHe]'s become so cute and insecure around you, always asking about [From.GetHerHis] hair and [From.GetHerHis] weight and giggling politely at every compliment you make to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure101;You are seeing some results for your troublesome [GetFromRelation]. [From.GetFirstName] spends some healthy amount of time at the mirror each morning, making sure to look at [From.GetHerHis] best, investing time and money on the betterment of [From.GetHerHis] appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure101;[From.GetFirstName] has started spending some more time checking [From.GetHerHis] hair, choosing some new fabulous clothes under your benevolent guidance, but [From.GetSheHe] shows still too little interest in the process, as if it wasn't the most important thing to worry about during [From.GetHerHis] whole day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure101;As little as it is, [From.GetFirstName] seems to be giving some attention on how to dress and act, but that's no more than the bare minimum one would expect from everyone. There's no passion, no imagination, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't understand the art behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure101;You thought you almost saw [From.GetFirstName] staring at a mirror today, but no such luck, sadly. How can your [GetFromRelation] be still so uncaring about [From.GetHerHis] looks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure101;Somewhere, hidden under layers of indifference, there might be a sense of aesthetic inside [From.GetFirstName]'s soul. There's still a long way to find it, though. You cannot believe how someone like [From.GetHerHim] could care so little on how others see [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure101;How frustrating, your [GetFromRelation] seems to care as little about you as [From.GetSheHe] cares about [From.GetHerHis] looks. There seems to be no way to dissuade the [From.GetFirstName] to even look at [From.GetHerHis] reflection from time to time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure101;*Flatter [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure101;*Shame [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure101;*Bash [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure102;How can you possibly reach perfection with the limitations imposed to you by your own body? There must be another way, no clothes, no hairstyle, no demeanor can ultimately hide the small imperfections plaguing your face. They must be carved out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure102;There must be some other way, you already spend so much time to look at your best, but, for all [From.GetHerHis] praise, [From.GetFirstName] still thinks there might be room for improvement. Indeed, it would be shameful to stop now, when you already have such an advantageous starting point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure102;At first it was just to experiment some new stuff, but now it has become more of an habit. You've a newfound interest in yourself, how to better look, how to better act around other people, how to sit, how to stand, how to dress. It's all so deliciously complicate and you cannot wait to learn more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure102;Getting powders and perfumes the likes [From.GetFirstName] cannot stop from suggesting might be too much, but you've found a strange comfort in spending some time at the mirror in the morning, making sure look at your best before meeting your courtiers and friends. It gives some unexpected confidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure102;You barely noticed yourself combing your hair today. All this expectation from [From.GetFirstName] and other courtiers must have sneaked inside your head. Still, there should not be anything wrong with a few adjustments from time to time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] sent you some extremely flamboyant clothes as a gift, hoping they would help you understand the need to take care of your looks. Why does [From.GetSheHe] even care what you look like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] would just not stop praising your looks, swearing a little care is all you need to reach true perfection. It is such a strange attitude, to think wasting so much time and wealth on mere appearances could be worth anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure102;[From.GetFirstName] has kept on bothering you with [From.GetHerHis] empty flattering, still hoping you could pick some interest in the empty praises to beauty and fashion. Sometimes you almost wish you understood what this obsession really meant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure102;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure102;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure102;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure102;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure103;It's no use changing details, you need to sculpt a better face for yourself. Only then, you will reach true beauty, only then people will stop snickering at your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure103;Every time you feel closer to perfection, [From.GetFirstName] is there, ready to prove you wrong, to point out all the things that you missed, all that still needs to be worked on. How could have you been so blind? The change must be radical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure103;Why is it so hard? You can see [From.GetFirstName]'s harsh words were not uncalled for now, you've started looking for new ways to nurture your look, but for any spot you cover, one more springs out of nowhere, one more thing to trim, adjust, replace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure103;You've started giving greater attention to how you look and act around others, but it's still not enough, you can still hear them snickering behind your back, pointing at all the imperfections and questionable choices in attire you've picked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure103;All this sharp comments, even from other courtiers, are really starting to become unbearable. Do you really look so terrible? Maybe you could spend some time improving your image...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure103;You don't really understand [From.GetFirstName]'s attitude. First [From.GetSheHe] spends hours spitting shrouded insults at you, then [From.GetSheHe] starts spewing advices on how to improve your image. Why can't [From.GetSheHe] just think for [From.GetHerHim]self?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure103;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, how out of style are your clothes, how dreadful does your hair look, how much would you benefit from powdering your face. It's such a meaningless concern for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure103;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks and demeanour, as if you would care anything [From.GetSheHe] or any other empty person would think about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure103;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure103;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure103;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure103;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure104;You cannot bear to be yelled at any longer by [From.GetFirstName], spewing how ugly you are yet. You must take drastic measures now. You must change what nature got wrong and move towards beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure104;There was no misunderstanding in [From.GetFirstName]'s yelling this time. Your appearance cannot be improved by things as limited as powders and lotions, it's your very flesh that needs to be treated. Only then you shall be able to reach perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure104;As you leave [From.GetFirstName] chambers after yet another scolding over your sloven looks, you start to understand what you have might be a real problem. You thought you could manage, spend more time, hire some servants to counsel you on the best way to present yourself, but it's clearly not enough. You must be a desperate case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure104;The constant threats of [From.GetFirstName] have been a huge incentive, now you have to spend at least an hour each day on the morning to make sure to look at your best. Even so, that's not even the bare minimum for your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetSheHe]'s insatiable for constant improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure104;You really tried to to be careful, brush your hair and all such frivolous things, but it's still not enough. You were berated once more by your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. What are you supposed to do? Waste days acting like some spoiled princess?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure104;Why is [From.GetFirstName] so upset? It seems like everyday now [From.GetSheHe] has to yell at you for some wrong mannerism or supposedly dreadful hairstyle or any other entirely frivolous matter [From.GetSheHe] may think of. By this point, you wonder if it wouldn't be easier to just entertain [From.GetHerHis] ideas for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure104;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of fashion, making empty threats against you if you persist to keep such an uncaring behaviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure104;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for slovenliness and ordering you to do something about it, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business how you look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure104;I will change the flesh and reach perfection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure104;I could... spend some more time on this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure104;I still find all this uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure104;Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. There are better things for a man of [From.GetHerHis] stature to do than look frivolous and effeminate, if not outright perverted. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure105;[From.GetFirstName] spent quite some time explaining you how [From.GetSheHe]'s not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about [From.GetHerHis] appearance. For a woman of [From.GetHerHis] calibre it would be damning to lose your reason for a self-absorbed life of frivolous nonsense. It doesn't seem like you'll get anything more from this one.You're not so insecure to be swayed by mere talk about your appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure105;I'm fine as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a more virile look, the battle-hardened warrior, the scar going just right to emphasize your good features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure107;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Just the retouching that you needed, a mysterious cut, running just along the right places to emphasize your good features, making you so much more interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure107;Yes, this will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. How much did he scream to gain his new scar, you wonder? Such a great prize, although coming from a complete different sort of battle, of which you are certainly the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10705;It is time to see the results of your gracious and just meddling: [From.GetFirstName] is sporting some nice new interesting looks. Normally one would consider such a cut an imperfection, but in the middle of her otherwise plain appearance, it gains such a special quality... In fact you think it might be even giving some value to her other boring features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10705;A good work, but perfection has yet to be reached...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure108;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Proceeding further, adding another line, you start seeing your design taking form. You're like a painter, you finally realize. And your face is still such a blank slate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure108;You let the blade run through your skin, as softly and firmly as possible, looking at the red line in the reflection of your mirror. Proceeding further, adding another line, you start seeing your design taking form. You're like a painter, you finally realize. And your face is still such a blank slate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure108;More red!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed himself to be. Here he is, completely transfigured. His face is terrible and in this terror there is something beautiful. Some in the court might think him a madman to do this, but the fact that you alone can truly understand the greatness of his work, makes it even more sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure10805;What a surprise [From.GetFirstName] revealed herself to be. Few men would look at her without turning pale. But for you, she's become a forbidden beauty. The mere thought makes your skin crawl with pleasure, to dare looking at the magnificent fruits of your labour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10805;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure109;The long days of studying in your laboratory, mixing potions and weaving spells have finally come to their fruition. With some last arcane words you drink the philtre and quickly turn to the mirror to watch your skin writhe and change. Now you truly have the perfect form, the kind whose charms few have resisted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure109;The long days of studying in your laboratory, mixing potions and weaving spells have finally come to their fruition. With some last arcane words you drink the philtre and quickly turn to the mirror to watch your skin warp and change. Now you truly have the perfect form, the kind whose beauty the bards sing about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure109;Magic solves every problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure10905;[From.GetFirstName] has outdone himself. With his arts, he found a way to use the Winds of Magic as the tools to sculpt his face. Only you can see all which has changed, every little detail. So delicate, yet, on the whole, so radical a change. He'll soon be the envy of many young fops in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure110;Your [GetFromRelation]'s concerns seems to be really with your health.

EVTOPTBspleasure110;I'll take care of my own body, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has become a real glutton, hardly remaining one day without stuffing [From.GetHerHis] face from morning to evening. At the end of the day [From.GetSheHe] needs servants to carry [From.GetHerHim] to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure111;Now that [From.GetSheHe] started getting a taste of it, your [GetFromRelation] is really appreciating [From.GetHerHis] new diet, carelessly gorging on new delicacies and exotic food every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] has finally started to stuff [From.GetHerHim]self properly, with less encouraging required on your part. Keeping on like this, [From.GetSheHe] will get as plump as you wished [From.GetHerHim] to be.  At the beginning [From.GetSheHe] was a little nauseous, but now [From.GetSheHe]'s started to crave for new dishes and spices every night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure111;Your ceaseless work has certainly resulted in some minor improvement in your [GetFromRelation]'s looks, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't shy from partaking in a large feast once in a while. You can see the first result of your influence in [From.GetHerHis] distended belly and relaxed demeanour, but there's still much to go yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure111;Your efforts managed to get [From.GetFirstName] to assume what you would consider a healthier diet, but this will still not do, [From.GetSheHe]'s still too undernourished, [From.GetSheHe] needs larger meals to recover entirely and gain the more amiable appearance you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure111;Paying some kitchen boys to hide some sugar and honey inside your [GetFromRelation]'s bread seems to have been a good idea. [From.GetFirstName] looks already less pale and starving without being any wiser.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly thin, always refusing any delicacy you have the kitchen boys slip into [From.GetHerHis] table. Going on like this [From.GetSheHe] might actually be getting skinnier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure111;[From.GetFirstName] still completely disregards your just concerns, [From.GetSheHe]'s so disgustingly skinny, you could swear you see bones sticking out under [From.GetHerHis] skin, how could anyone enjoy being such a corpse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure112;You cannot remember the last time you felt satiated, every second of your waking life is now a constant struggle against the unending hunger [From.GetFirstName]'s honeyed words have bestowed unto you. Luckily, you've found stuffing yourself until you can barely move as a more than pleasant state of being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure112;With your [GetFromRelation]'s kind guidance, your appetite has grown near insatiable. Every dinner is a feast for you and not too rarely you call your servants during the night to ask for more food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure112;[From.GetFirstName]'s insistent suggestions were all that was needed to tease your appetite. You can barely miss a day without trying something new. Your cravings having been refined as well, you can no longer feel content with the frugal meals you enjoyed before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDspleasure112;Since you've started following [From.GetFirstName]'s counsel regarding your diet, you've surely felt more relaxed and free in your choice of meals. But your [GetFromRelation] still encourages you each break to try fancy new dishes. At the end of the week you're often feeling bloated and near-sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure112;After [From.GetFirstName]'s numerous concerned talks, you've started to indulge a little every once in a while. Everyone around you swears it has only done good to your health. It's certainly a less stressful attitude, but you still worry it could get out of hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure112;With all the concerned praise you're receiving about your eating habits, you're starting to wonder if you shouldn't be a little less strict, if nothing for the sake of your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure112;It's the third time you see [From.GetFirstName] slipping something near your plate. At this point it would almost feel more unsettling if [From.GetSheHe] were trying to poison you. Naturally, [From.GetSheHe] kept on smiling and praising you for your constraint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure112;Does [From.GetSheHe] makes any sense? First [From.GetSheHe] weaves all sort of praises around you, on how virtuous and temperate you are, but then suggest it might be good for you to not starve yourself as much as you supposedly do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZZspleasure112;More, I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure112;Nothing wrong in indulging a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCDspleasure113;Every time you indulge during a large feast, you end up with your belly stretched and with a sleepy disposition, yet when you voice your concerns [From.GetFirstName] is ready to harshly rebuke them, telling you it is your deviant mindset to see sickness instead of average health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEspleasure113;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent veiled insults, you've stopped worrying too much about your meals. After all, if people will complain at you for your moderation and the fasting might be damaging your health, why insist?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure113;With all the shameful quips you're receiving from your [GetFromRelation], you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure113;[From.GetFirstName] is back again with [From.GetHerHis] cheap shots against you, suggesting you might have been in some kind of illness or disgrace to deny yourself even the bare amount of food a person needs to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure113;It's almost laughable how [From.GetFirstName] still is trying to make you feel some sort of shame for your looks, claiming you to be obsessed with your figure to the point of starving yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCEspleasure114;After [From.GetFirstName]'s frequent warnings, you've decided to assume a new diet. After all your health should come before your looks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFspleasure114;After all the times your [GetFromRelation] has yelled and warned you about how dangerous it is for you to keep such a debilitatingly frugal diet, you've started to wonder if you really might have been unknowingly depriving yourself too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGspleasure114;[From.GetFirstName] has called you one more time for another harsh scolding over your allegedly absolute lack of judgement, trying to scare you on what the consequences would be for your body if you keep starving yourself as [From.GetSheHe] thinks you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHspleasure114;How dares [From.GetFirstName] treat you like this! Summoning you, reprimanding you for unhealthy diet, as if it was any of [From.GetHerHis] business what do you eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure115;But I *am* concerned! Nothing? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure117;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded.

EVTOPTAspleasure117005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure118;You fall back on your chair again, gasping heavily, looking down at the bulging belly peeking from your clothes. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a morbid slob, with a chin too many, and soft jiggly arms you can barely raise to put more food in your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure118;After one last exhausting step, you finally reach your chair and sit down, resting your breasts over your belly. [From.GetFirstName]'s influence turned you into a fat cow, your hips have grown so large and plump you can barely move without setting your legs on fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure118;So tired... need a snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure11805;The endless indulging has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain forgettable man, he's now become way more interesting and big.

EVTDESCAspleasure119;You smile faintly, nodding to your servants, so that they can shove another batch of food down your throat. You have no longer the strength to move, nor you wish to.

EVTOPTAspleasure125;But I *am* concerned! Nothing? Fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure127;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded.

EVTDESCBspleasure127;[From.GetFirstName]'s concerns seemed suspicious at first, but, looking at yourself in the mirror right now you cannot deny they were founded.

EVTOPTAspleasure127;Feels good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12705;Your work has given its fruits: your [GetFromRelation] is finally looking less like a bloated slob and more like a healthy and strong man, one not to to crush horses under his behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure127005;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure128;You look at your reflection once more, searching for imperfections. There's not many of them any more. With the help of [From.GetFirstName] you've gained a body any mortal would be jealous of. Sure, some may say you look a bit pale and shaky, but it's merely the price for what you've reached.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure128;You toss away another dress, another of your favourite has become too large for you. You have not much use for so-called 'curves' any longer, thanks to [From.GetFirstName]. You're in such a shape to be the envy of all the women in the realm. It needs to be properly admired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure128;But always be vigilant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: from being such a plain and forgettable man, he's refined his body, tossing away all the rough matter, exalting his true essence. The way he slowly changed, every ounce of flesh removed after the other, the process itself is an artistic masterpiece that you had the luck to witness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure12805;The endless fasting has greatly transformed your [GetFromRelation]: she started slowly, losing inches around her chest and sides, then her face and waist.

EVTOPTAspleasure12805;A perfect sculpture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspleasure129;You look faintly at your reflection, ignoring the food laying beneath your bed. It's smell disgusts you, but you have no longer the strength to move. Yet, you look so slim and beautiful now. There's not an ounce of fat in all of your body.

EVTDESCAspleasure12905;Why did you ever doubt yourself? You thought [From.GetFirstName] could never grow smaller than he already was, but you underestimated your skills and his determination.

EVTDESCAspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] has really become insatiable, trying new games and new players nearly every night, exploring new uncharted heights in pleasure and pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspleasure131;[From.GetFirstName] fully understands the game and, although [From.GetSheHe] has yet to master it, [From.GetSheHe]'s grown knowledgeable enough to tire even yourself. You can finally run wild with your imagination on [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCspleasure131;You can finally enjoy [From.GetFirstName]'s full attentions, while helping [From.GetHerHim] finding more friends to spend the night with and new toys and games to play with. It might be the good time to push for something more extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAspleasure16406;There's little you remember any more. You've found your home in a nice little swamp, filled with delicious flies. Maybe this year you'll find a mate and have hundreds of little tadpoles with it. There's nothing more to life after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCA_spleasure2;You've always prized your impeccable poetic skills. Yet, as of late, you've had more and more trouble with inspiration. It's so hard to think of something meaningful any more, it seems like all the greatest, most sublime topics have already been exhausted by Ulthuan's long list of esteemed composers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure2;You've always prized your impeccable poetic skills. Yet, as of late, you've had more and more trouble with inspiration. The dreaded fear and cold sophistication of Druchii architecture and the damp forests of Naggaroth can only be applied for so long after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure2;Maybe I could try taking... something... to enhance my point of view?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure2;It is said suffering helps the poet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure2;I'm sure I'll find something, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure3;It's not easy to find certain philtres in Ulthuan, but alchemists have to use all sorts of reagents for their experiments. In the end you were able to find and make use of what you needed. The thrill itself was enough to tingle your senses, but the experience right after was something indescribable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure3;The New World is filled with strange plants and fungi used for certain rituals, it didn't take long for you to find what you needed. In the end you were able to find and make use of what you needed. The thrill itself was enough to tingle your senses, but the experience right after was something indescribable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure3;I can touch the Winds of Magic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure4;You spend sometime wondering the moral ramifications of your action, but in the end, you agree with yourself it can be an enriching experience. As you observe life slowly dripping away from your wrists, you experience an unfathomable new sensation. When you finally press the wound closed, what you've lost in blood, you've gained tenfold in inspiration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure4;It's not something unheard of amongst Khaine followers after all. As you observe life slowly dripping away from your wrists, you experience an unfathomable new sensation. When you finally press the wound closed, what you've lost in blood, you've gained tenfold in inspiration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure4;What if I used it instead of ink? How deep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure5;You can see the hordes of daemonic hordes riding over your fingers. They are so distinct... Yet they're fading away already, you need more of the substance. You can't come unprepared when they come back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure5;They're still on my hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure6;You could have touched the heavenly figure, it was right in front of you, so alluring... Yet now she has disappeared, you need more of the substance. Reality has become so dull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure6;Where's my dust?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure7;You pick a fruit from the heavenly garden, yet, when put it between your lips it turns into your finger. The effects are fading again, you need more of the substance. Reality has become so dull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure7;Where did I leave it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure8;Your multiple experiences really opened your mind, you can see things in such a broad spectrum. As long as you take more of the substance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure8;Yes, yes, I see all now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure9;It took you a while to notice, but as got out of your drug-induced trance, you glanced at the servant peeling from the curtains, spying on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure9;He can join me, there's enough of it for two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure9;Want to see something? *Grab him*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure9;Maybe it's time to stop with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure10;The servant appears scared at first, but once you force him to inhale some of your ailment, he calms himself, happily joining you. The experience is even better with someone else, maybe you should convince more people to join in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure10;Yes, just let your mind roam...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPspleasure10;[Root.GetFirstName] unlocked the targeted decision 'Twist'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure11;You drag the servant across the floor and press his face into your last bag of dust, leaving him shaking and choking. After some time, he finally stops, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure11;How do you like that? What is your *soul* seeing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure12;Each day you give thanks for the inspiration that has led you thus far but although you still feel the thrill when pain dances across your flesh, as time goes on you long to feel something even harsher. As you wonder this things, you find yourself soothed by the chirping of a lovely songbird scampering near your window. For a while you simply delight in its song but eventually your thoughts begin to turn and you start to wonder if perhaps you could inspire it to even greater heights of artistry. How much more beautiful and moving would it be if he went to the same suffering as you subordinate yourself to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure12;I must know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure12;That's base, I'll cleanse this thought from my flesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure12;That's enough, never again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure13;It's growing faint so quickly, but you cannot deny the unique and sublime tone given to birds' notes. It might have been its last song, but you're brought to tears by that very perfection you helped it reach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure13;It was... enchanting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure14;You start punishing your own flesh, but as you go on, you start seeing the art of your work, the passion inside every cut. You quickly grab a mirror and start drawing red lines over your face, ecstatic at the sight of your coming masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure14;Sublime!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure15;Your scholarly studies give you plenty of time for peaceful contemplation and the enjoyment of solitude. All alone in the great library, you cannot fail to think of the books as little universes, hanging to your whims, depending on your care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure15;A slight change here or there, and history itself is rewritten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure15;Like the world, they could have little daemons roaming inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure15;They should always be preserved at their best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure16;You smirk, complimenting yourself on your work and passing to the next volume. So many great deeds were committed by your ancestors you didn't know about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure16;It's like bending time itself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure17;Another little miniature is ready and you move to look for a good spot for the next one. They are so well hidden. The future generations will look at the marvels of these pages and ignore the obscenities laughing at them from the paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure17;It's so delightful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pompous, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, giving you sleazy looks every time he thinks you're not watching him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure18;Your days of quiet enjoyment seems to have come to an end. A young apprentice has come to the library to study. A pretentious, nagging little brat, asking you for directions every hour, outrageously flirting as if her very presence was a gift to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure18;It's a vast and ancient library one could easily get lost in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure18;Let's see if the brat can really handle what it craves for...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure18;Walking close to the staircase, I see? Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure18;I'll just have to bear with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure19;Who knows when the poor student is getting out of the old storage room. It's so dark and twisted, how could the brat even end there, you wonder? Here's to hoping the poor soul doesn't get eaten by rats. On the other hand, his muffled screams for help are so soothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure19;It sounds like a lullaby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The boy turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with him assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure20;It wasn't so bad. The girl turned out to be experienced at least in something. And going rough with her assured you some days of quiet in the future. You couldn't deny you enjoyed having the chance to choke the little brat, if only for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure20;A teacher *should* spank their students from time to time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure21;It takes just one little trip. You have to bear the squealing voice of the annoying twerp only up to when the brat's head squashes on the floor below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure21;What a beautiful silence. Poetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure22;You were doing some testing for a new concoction in your laboratory, but something has gone wrong. The rat you used for your experiment has started to slowly and painfully choke after tasting the substance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure22;This needs to be closely observed, yes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure22;I'll check on it later, let's try something else first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure22;Better to end the poor creature's suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure23;Despite your careful examination, you cannot find the source of the problem. You have to admit to yourself though, watching the creature gasping for its last breath from above, like a passive deity, filled you with a smug sense of satisfaction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure23;It just comes with the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure24;When you return with a new mix, you find out the rat has not yet drawn its last breath. You have it ingest the new substance and while the creature dies, there's a series of fascinating side-effects accompanying its death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure24;How interesting. I'll need another rat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25;You really looked forward the visit of your distant colleague, you'd had a thrilling correspondence in the last months. Yet, now that you have him here, you are starting to seriously question your judgement. The short-sighted fool is dismissing many of your accomplishments, accusing you of using experiments just as a pretence to kill and torture your test subjects. He has even started to threaten you to call authorities to have you answer of some of these supposed transgressions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25;Your brain doesn't work. Let me check it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure25;Allow me then to show you this great brew I tested on rats some time ago...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure25;Maybe he's right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure25005;Your colleague finally stops twitching. Some more stitches and he'll be free to go. Of course he was belittling you, the lymph determining his pride and envy were cluttering his brain, you had to remove an entire piece to cure him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure25005;Ssshhh, it's all over now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure26;There's no real difference. Like the rat, the scholar can only look at you from below now, in awe and terror, as he chokes on his own blood. The post-mortem reactions seem to be considerably different from your last tests with rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure26;I should try it with more people then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure27;Since your youth you've been admired for your intelligence. Yet, at the same time, when you've put it into practice, you've always had people complain and snort, opting for the most stupid of decisions. Like the minor noble in front of you right now, bragging about his mediocre accomplishments and calling your wisdom cowardice and self-entitlement. Why gifted people such as you should suffer idiots of his sort?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure27;If you so desire, I'll humiliate you right now in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure27;Speak on, I'll speak later, to the right people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure27;If I answered in kind, I'd be as stupid as he is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure28;When you're finished with him, the courtier is so ashamed he cannot spit a word back. As if it wasn't enough recounting his many failings, you inflame the court against him and he's soon driven out by shouts and threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure28;See?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure29;Seeing you not answering him, the courtier keeps on bragging, finally leaving the room when satisfied with his work. In a few days you send your people to the countryside, spreading enough vicious rumours to utterly destroy his reputation, while at the same time maintaining yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure29;That's where the genius lies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure30;The events at court in the last weeks still haunt you. The thrill, the satisfaction of having the entire court hanging from your lips, then pitted against that insufferable idiot... It wouldn't be bad to feel it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure30;There's plenty of fools, it's only a question of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure30;No, it's not warranted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure31;You are about to send another peasant off to his ironic and well fitted punishment, when one of your spies comes whispering into your ears the bragging courtier is dead by his own hand. He committed suicide to escape the shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure31;Ah! Thus proving once more what a fool he was!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure32;You've always had a sweet tooth and enjoyed foods of all sorts, filling your belly with exotic delicacies gives you an indescribable sense of satisfaction. Yet many at court frown on your taste as inappropriate for an Elven noblewoman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCE_spleasure32;Nobody can deny you enjoy a good celebration every once in a while. The thing is, as of late, nothing seems to excite you anymore. After years of experience, it seems you're out of ideas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure32;They're wrong, I don't care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure32;Maybe I could use a little moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure32;A little indulgence won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure32;No, I'm committed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure32;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure32;Well, that happens when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure33;Why did you even doubt yourself? This is the way you like spending your life. Why negate some simple pleasure to try and reach the unattainable ideal of Elven beauty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure33;They are just bones wrapped in judgemental skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure34;Having to let yourself go for a while was nice and all, but now you worry if you're not overdoing with all the large meals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure34;Just one more snack...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure35;Your wild feast seems a success, there's all sort of grotesque entertainment going on, things to make an Asur blush. You're having the time of your life, when some stupid page has the gall to voice his absolute repulsion for the whole spectacle, calling your guests weakling sycophants and you a depraved vixen with no shame, as if being the only one in the room to be still dressed gave him more nobility than the one in your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure35;Pile on him! Pile on him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure35;Maybe we've gone a tad bit too far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure36;When you wake up in the morning in the garden, naked and wrapped around in a fur cloak by the statue of an Elven God-like, you can barely remember what exactly happened the night before. One thing was clear: it was awesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure36;And whatever happened to that servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure37;Ignoring the courtiers' prattling seemed to quell your conscience for some time, yet now you are starting to notice how less and less dresses fit you and how tiring moving has become. You can barely fit your behind on the throne any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure37;I don't mind, it's all so good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure37;What am I becoming? Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure38;Why others even care so much? Should you starve yourself like a peasant? They're only envious of you, that's all, they know what they're missing out. Maybe you should show them, some time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure38;Why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure39;The Gods teach moderation and abstinence, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure39;Khaine is not soft on weakness, but you've always had trouble with it. Is it so wrong to lay down for a while and enjoy a good glass of wine with some friends? Or a barrel of mead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure39;You've always followed the austere dictates of the Gods, always kept your mind clear to better fight corruption and Chaos. Yet, sometimes you envy the simple joys of inebriation and carousing. Would it be so wrong to give into it once in a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAspleasure39;I'll drink to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure39;Maybe I should spend more time sober...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure39;A little sip won't really hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure39;Doesn't matter. Can't afford to risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure39;Or maybe not... Just need to dig *deeper*...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure39;Well, the desensitization comes when you live for centuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure40;Why worry about the Gods? Surely they drink too from time to time. You remember seeing a statue of one holding a bottle. Or did you put it there one of your nights out? The memory is blurry right now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure40;If it fitted, it means *he* wanted it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure41;Since you started drinking, every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor. How could you miss all this for so long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCA_spleasure44;As a mockery from the Gods themselves, the sense of inebriation has started to fade in the last days. Doesn't matter how much you drink, you can only get so little enjoyment from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure44;Time to move to something stronger than alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure44;It's probably a sign of mercy. Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure45;You were right, alcohol was just the tip of a great new universe of sensation you've unlocked. There are so many substances, so many ways to see the world... And those narrow-minded fools see it as weakness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure45;I could show them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure46;Asur frown upon the weak temptation of the flesh, yet you've always had a hard time adhering to this principle. Even worst, recently nothing seems to satisfy your lust anymore.

EVTDESCH_spleasure46;You've always just wanted to mind your own plots and raids, yet you have Witches and Sorceresses of all kinds walking around half-naked day in day out. How is someone to keep his head clear and plan anything in these conditions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure46;I could try a stronger approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure46;The fire will return, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure46;Maybe I could try something more... unorthodox? Just once?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure46;I... no, no, no, I just can't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure47;You push the young man on the floor, sinking your nails into his skin and twisting his arm. The woman joins you with a whip, trying to catch you off guard, but you take her wrist in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure47;You push the young woman on the floor, sinking your nails into his skin and twisting his arm. The man joins you with a whip, trying to catch you off guard, but you take her wrist in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure47;Give it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure47;That's enough for today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure48;You lick the blood off your hands, wrapped around the two young quivering mates. You weren't so sure at the beginning, but now all sorts of nice ideas are coming to your mind for the next sessions, you've been really missing out on something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure48;Maybe I'll pick someone else, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure49;The young man straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure49;The young woman straps you tighter to the bed, spitting on you and glancing at the tools to see what to use next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure49;Yes! Yes, tell me how I deserve this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure49;That's too much, stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure50;Once the traveller leaves you tied up in the bed, you are exhausted, but at the same time, you still yearn for more. There must be other interesting ways to experience what you did, you could make some research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure50;Yes, very deep research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure51;You are rightfully and justly feared by your servants and vassals alike, as proper Druchii highborn should. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a servants trips you by accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure51;Several at court seem to dislike your harsh methods. You are just wondering how more enjoyment did you find in exacting your punishments when a courtier dares to speak against your final verdict on a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCC_spleasure51;You never really liked violence, much to the ridicule of your Druchii peers. When a farmer you just pardoned ends up in court again for stealing and pleads to you, you start seeing their point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCD_spleasure51;You've always kept true to the Gods and exerted kindness and good judgement in your actions. Yet, sometimes, the stupidity of your servants, the mockery of your courtiers, they really push you to edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure51;You miserable wretch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure51;You know what? He's beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure51;That's it! Now you're getting it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFspleasure51;Patience, patience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure52;The courtier cries for forgiveness at every lash, but you still feel like he's not had enough. Exacting the punishment by yourself, without the jailer, makes it feel so much more intimate and satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure52;The servant cries for forgiveness at every lash, but you still feel like he's not had enough. Exacting the punishment by yourself, without the jailer, makes it feel so much more intimate and satisfying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure52;You think it's over? We're just getting started here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure52;I think you've learned your lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure53;You emerge the dungeon soaked in blood and with a heavy breath. The new prisoner is not getting out for some time. The wonders you did to him... It was almost artistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure53;We need to do this more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure54;You have the farmer flogged on the public square. He almost looked surprised at your verdict, probably he hoped to get free again. Not anymore. And besides, watching the executioner rip the flesh from his back is so gratifying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_spleasure54;The maiden deserved that punishment, she was clumsy and irresponsible. It was so gratifying and just to give to her her rightful punishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure54;It's your fault! You brought this upon yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure54;I'm so sorry, I don't know what came to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure55;Each wound... Is like a painting celebrating justice, it's almost inebriating. Kindness doesn't mean foolishness after all. One needs to be harsh to be loving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure55;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure56;You've discovered new depths of pleasure that most people can only dream of. Why not bestow your knowledge to others as well? You've gained the 'Twist' targeted decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure56;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure57;You awoke with a sense of choking. You gasped, searching for air, but something large and wet is blocking your mouth. It takes some time to realize it is your very tongue, overgrown and blackened to unnatural proportions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure57;I can hide it, with magic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure57;There must be some way to mask this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure57;No point in hiding it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure58;There something itching on your head. When you move your hand up to scratch yourself, you realize two twisted horns are spurring from your forehead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure58;I can hide them, with magic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure58;There must be some way to mask this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure58;No point in hiding it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure59;It takes sometime to recognize the image you see in the reflection of your mirror. Some invisible hand has touched your features, blessing you with nobler traits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure59;Works for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure60;It takes sometime to recognize the image you see in the reflection of your mirror. Some invisible hand has touched your features, cursing you with obscene traits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure60;Beauty is subjective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure61;There so much still to do, every new accomplishment in the heights of pleasure is overshadowed by a new greater compulsion. Will you ever be able to reach true perfection?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure61;Of course I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure62;With a clever use of your skills, you managed to hide your deformity, so as to pass like any normal person when in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure62;There must be a permanent solution...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure63;You hoped to hide your overgrown tongue, but no matter what, your courtiers soon caught on your act and rumours already started to spread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure63;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure64;You hoped to hide your new horns, but no matter what, your courtiers soon caught on your act and rumours already started to spread.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure64;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure65;You've been exposed as a twisted servant of the Dark Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure65;Preposterous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure66;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been exposed as a servant of the Dark Prince of Pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure66;Time to come out and play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure66;How unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_spleasure67;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been exposed as a servant of the Dark Prince of Pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure67;Time to come out and play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure67;How unexpected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.69;You've decided to pick [From.GetFirstName] as the object of your attentions. What should you do with [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.69;Toy with [From.GetHerHis] mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.69;Titillate [From.GetHerHis] perception.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspleasure.69;Tease [From.GetHerHis] cravings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspleasure.69;Inflame [From.GetHerHis] lust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEspleasure.69;I changed my mind, [From.GetSheHe] bores me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.71;A little nudge here and there and [From.GetFirstName] has already started craving to better [From.GetHerHim]self, the first true step in the search for perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.71;But [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.71;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.72;Despite your efforts, [From.GetFirstName] still remains set in a complacent and sappy mindset, content with [From.GetHerHim]self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.72;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.72;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.73;You're attending at a feast in a foreign court when a masked figure comes close and starts talking to you. You spend hours discussing on the matters of beauty and pleasure and you start wondering if the man is trying to persuade you to join some cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.73;This looks really interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.73;Thanks, but no thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.74;You approached [From.GetFirstName] during a public event and talked with [From.GetHerHim] for some time, until you finally convinced [From.GetHerHim] of the error of [From.GetHerHis] ways. Your new pet is eager to know and experience more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.74;Perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.75;You approached [From.GetFirstName] during a public event and talked with [From.GetHerHim] for some time, but in the end, there was no way of convincing [From.GetHerHim] of loosening up, even just a little, to understand the error of [From.GetHerHis] ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.75;This is a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.77;A missing guard here, a misguided message there, it's hilarious how little things can twist someone's mind. [From.GetFirstName] has been on the edge for days, fearing for non-existent plots against [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.77;Give it more time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.77;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.78;Despite your efforts, [From.GetFirstName] still remains set in a complacent and trusting mindset, content with [From.GetHerHim]self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.78;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.78;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.80;Some well-placed rumours are all that takes to inflate someone's opinion. [From.GetFirstName] is filled with pride and would do anything to satiate [From.GetHerHis] thirst for flattery right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.80;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.80;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.81;You tried to make [From.GetFirstName] respect [From.GetHerHim]self more, but the humility and self-loathing seem to be strong in this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.81;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.81;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.83;Some nosy servants and anonymous gifts allowed [From.GetFirstName] to try some of the more exotic and pleasurable things in life, now that [From.GetSheHe] has gained an interest, nothing seems to satiate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.83;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.83;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.84;Despite your efforts, [From.GetFirstName] remains a bland and frugal person, boring in [From.GetHerHis] interests as much as in [From.GetHerHis] character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.84;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.84;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.86;Making sure the right servants slipped the right beverage in the right chalice is an art in itself. Now [From.GetFirstName] has already started to develop a more interesting and colourful personality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.86;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.86;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.88;Boytoys and wenches aren't hard to find and they can make the most believable actors when paid enough. It is delightful to think how one can be able to create love with precision and intent. For as long as [From.GetFirstName] believe them, isn't it true love?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.88;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.88;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspleasure.89;Using minor instruments to exact your art is demeaning and obviously can lead to gross mistakes. The help you hired to drag [From.GetFirstName] out of [From.GetHerHis] bland and uninteresting shyness has likely had the entire opposite effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspleasure.89;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] still needs more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspleasure.89;I'll approach [From.GetHerHim] anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# HAREM
#
EVTDESCharemsins001;You've decided to take a break and retire with your beloved boytoys in your palace. With plenty of servants, food and drinks, it might be what it takes to find some relief from the pressures of command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins001;Let the fun start!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins002;It was a good time, but you can't ignore your responsibilities forever. With a heavy heart, you finally called off your thralls and ordered the servants to clean up the mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins002;Time to get back to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins003;All these days spent with servants coming at your every word and loving beautiful youngsters whispering sweet things into your ears have really made you understand what a wonderful and special person you are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins003;I'm so beautiful and smart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins004;A drink goes down and another barrel is empty. All this merriment and euphoria are just what you needed to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins004;Pour in some more mead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins005;Having not to worry about battle plans and plots and just try out the last exotic delicacies with your thralls is just what you needed. Eating enough to have your belly filling your lap is an acquired taste in itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins005;Hmmmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins006;You already knew what you were getting into with your vacation, but after some days of unrestrained passion you hardly understand how could you go on without any.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins006;Call in that pretty servant over there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins007;It seems your celebration has had some collateral results. Your pregnancy is starting to show, with all its unpleasant effects, and you've been forced to call off the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins007;That's so unfair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins008;Every day is just another pleasant day of doing nothing. You can hardly think about getting back to your duties anymore. After all, you have servants to deal with those.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins008;Bring me... do... I don't even...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins009;Spending such a great  time with other people doing all sorts of things is really helping to let you appreciate the joys of being with others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins009;We're all having lots of fun here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins010;Why worry about wars, plots and conquest when someone can find joy and love already?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins010;I've already all that I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins011;The last thrall forces another choke of meat down your throat and the cycle begins anew. With their help you've eaten more in these days than you have in your entire life. Yet, no matter how bloated and sweaty you've become, you just can't stop asking for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins011;*omnomnomnomnom*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins012;You don't know what you drank in the last weeks, but you can't really focus as you did any more, and pretty much anything will make you jump off your feet. But you can see so many things that weren't there before, you must take more of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins012;What's THAT!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins013;You almost drowned one of the new servants in wine today. Spending so much time only interacting with close and known faces might be making you a little too suspicious of others...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins013;HE was the suspicious one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins014;Whether it be men or women, food or mead, you want it and aplenty, spending this time off let you understand there's nothing better than enjoying life as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins014;Nothing at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins015;Being away from the problems of rulership for some time has really helped you placate your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins015;Thoughts are so soothing now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins016;You have so many attentions from thralls and servants, all of them listening to you, encouraging you, that you've started to feel a little better about yourself lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins016;Maybe life isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins017;You've spent some time away from your responsibilities as a ruler, but now maybe it's time to go back at it, isn't it? Having to lay motionless for entire days doesn't really help anybody...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins017;It helps ME.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins017;Quick, assemble my council!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins018;You went on as long as you could, day after day, choking on foreign food and intoxicating elixirs, but your body cannot handle it any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins018;Just get me to bed, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins019;A second thrall comes over you, joining the first as he ravages your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins019;More, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins020;Having to wake with an hangover each morning, barely remembering what happened the previous day while being in no condition to live the next, has somehow lost its appeal to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins020;There are other ways to get intoxicated after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins020;Enough! Just get me some water and get out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins021;You glance nauseous at your bloated belly, trying to move on your side without throwing up. The servants wait around you with plates filled with more food, but right now it might as well be scorpions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins021;I'd rather do something else to waste time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins021;Enough prancing around, there's more important affairs to attend to!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins022;Strange to believe it, but all these days doing nothing but feeding your libido seems to have finally satiated it. Right now the mere thought of calling one of your thralls would make you throw up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins022;Give it a few days, it'll come back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins022;Then this whole thing has outlived its usefulness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCharemsins024;Empty flattery after empty flattery, you're starting to hate all this frivolous attention to your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAharemsins024;Less words, more fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBharemsins024;Enough of this, you bore me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# RAPE

EVTOPTArape0005;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0013;Your thrall stands before you, at the mercy of your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0013;I've no longer need of this one. Release [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBrape.0013;Snip him, I've grown tired of his privates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCrape.0013;Kill [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDrape.0013;I've something... special... in mind for this one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0015;The scared thrall is dragged in your private dungeon to receive whatever special treatment you have in mind for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0015;Keep still, I'm making some improvements on your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBrape.0015;Something really special for this fine specimen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCrape.0015;Something really special for you, little one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDrape.0015;Hm, thinking again, you bore me. Get lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0016;They always twitch, that can ruin a perfect work. But still, you're satisfied with your new piece. It's a new face altogether, something sublime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0016;Ever so close to perfection...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCArape.0017;The stables under the moonlight are such a suggestive setup. Your favourite horse is already struggling in his place, smelling the new mate you've brought to him. What a mighty steed. Sometimes you almost feel like joining the fun you're submitting your thrall to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBrape.0017;The stables under the moonlight are such a suggestive setup. Your favourite Nauglir is already struggling in his place, smelling the new mate you've brought to him. What magnificent scales does it sport. Sometimes you almost feel like joining the fun you're submitting your thrall to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0017;Why not? Are you done yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBrape.0017;Nah, he's having his fun already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0018;A few straps, needles and hooks, is all that a good artist really needs to have fun with, even if the subject of [Root.GetHerHis] affections is someone as base and meaningless as a thrall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0018;It's the gift of a true artist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0019;Draining blood, cutting flesh, there's all sorts of ways one can refine the body of even the most unworthy subject. You are really happy with the result of your work, the deadly look of the thrall really speaks to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0019;Lean and refined.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0020;The eyes of this one was what really caught your attention. They are so beautiful. Especially now that you had them added to your personal painter's last masterpiece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0020;They can still stare! It's beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0021;It takes just little one spoonful of powder to create the most hilarious reactions in children. Look at how [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] frets still. It almost makes one wonder what marvellous and terrible things the substance is allowing [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] to see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0021;I'll join the kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBrape.0021;Looking at [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] is way better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0022;After some time, you've run out of things, yet you still think the kid could be made to eat something more. It's almost fascinating, really. And you work has made [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] so plump and soft...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0022;It looks almost... delicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBrape.0022;Let's see if there's something more upstairs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0023;You really cannot understand when they cry. They become part of something beautiful, the sweetest of sensations binding two souls together. Certain to be one of their fondest memories in adulthood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0023;I still remember my first time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0024;The mind of a child is such a pure and delicate thing, to twist it is easy, but bending it to a point is the skill of a master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0024;Such as myself, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCArape.0025;What a thrilling and unique experience. Why do you even keep the most passionate of your lovers confined in the stables?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0025;It's cruel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0026;You might have underestimated the ardour of your steed. In the frenzy of the passion he ended up hopelessly trampling your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTArape.0026;Still... worth... it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCrape.0011;AI Dummy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsinsa11142;Having to ride out or even walk after eating so much always makes you nauseous. You had also planned a fencing session today, but perhaps you should take a break...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1142;I'm not feeling like doing anything right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1142;Wouldn't be healthy do nothing after eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11143;You were planning for a walk after the sixth course, but you're feeling too heavy and tired to walk anywhere right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11144;Your whole life is a failure, there is really no point in doing anything if it's always going to be the wrong thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsinsa11146;Every night is a party, things normally so bland, suddenly become hilarious through the alcohol induced stupor I'm keeping myself into. Despite a few rough mornings, I can barely remember the last time I was sad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1146;Life is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1146;Yeah, but I can barely remember *anything* at all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11147;Another day passes by, spent sitting on my nice soft couch and gorging upon the last delicacies of my cooks. Everything would be fine, if not because I'll have to skip second breakfast tomorrow morning to let the tailor take again my measures for new clothes. Perhaps I can make the servants feed me while he works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1147;He better take them good this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11149;I've lost every appetite. I do nothing, why should I eat anything? I'm not hungry anyway. My body has grown skinnier and sharper as days passed by, even the faintest of the noises and lights bothers me and I find harder to focus for longer times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1149;Am I dreaming right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11154;I know the value of good work and moderation, yet my body is still cursed by past wickedness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1154;I must try to get back into shape, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1154;I've really a lot to worry about already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11155;The rush of appetite I've been having lately has truly been good to me: I feel less tired, everyone at court says I look healthier and my bones do not stick out anymore from under my skin. I do worry about overdoing though...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1155;Nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1155;Maybe it's better to return to more frugal habits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa1200;Your helmet falls off and the enemy's blade strikes true. When you come to your senses again, your whole face has been covered in bandages, covering a ghastly disfigurement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1200;My face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11182;Lately your sour humour has brought you to contemplate your delicate features, the ones bards used to sing about in your halls. Nothing brings you comfort, your life is an unending cycle of suffering... Nothing good ever happens to you, why then you have such a pretty face? As you look at your reflection, you realize you have a blade in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11183;The blade carves deep in your skin, peeling off slices of flesh, painting you of the dark colours of your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11184;In the past few days you thought back to how close you came to disfigure yourself over nothing. The shock has somehow awaken you. Why should you keep living like this any longer? Don't you have suffered enough without beating yourself too? Maybe a more sunny disposition could be what you really need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsinsa11185;You weren't even brave enough to rightfully punish yourself for your beauty. Now your untarnished face haunts you in every corner, reminding of your undeserving looks. Today it was once too much and to escape the guilt you ended up jumping off a balcony. Your servants managed to get you healed in time sadly, but you are permanently crippled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1182;I don't deserve this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsinsa1182;Is this really what I'm reduced to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1183;The pain is my friend, the pain is good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1184;I shall not fall so low again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsinsa1185;I deserve this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
