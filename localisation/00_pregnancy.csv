EVTDESCsins1110;As the time passes, you feel more and more restless. The changes in your body are constraining you, turning what was once a mundane task into a challenge. It's been days since you've been out in the gardens. It's so frustrating!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1110;It won't be for long, just have to try not to think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1110;Maybe I could find some solace in the cellar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1111;You were right, after all! Drinking a little every night has helped a lot with relieving the tension. You've started feeling a little dizzy, but it's not like you have to do anything important in the next months anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1111;I think I'll ask the servants for another round before going to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1115;You can't stand it! All these days passing by while you can't do anything, trapped in your chambers, waiting for this *thing* to come out, giving you nothing but headache and nausea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1115;It's horrible! When will it finally be over?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1112;It was only after the fifth course that you realized how much you had eaten that dinner. It has become so hard to tell when it's enough when your body is already bloated, hosting a little insatiable pest. Perhaps you should stop bothering at all and just eat whenever you're hungry. A lot of courtiers have assured you it'll all go nourish the child anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1112;That's no excuse, I should still use moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1112;Sixth course, here I come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1113;Things have become much better, finally. You feel a lot less under pressure with your new diet. In fact, you cannot hide a small hint of pleasure for every time you gorge yourself on whatever the cooks have prepared. Besides, it's all to make a healthy child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1113;I'll stop the moment the little thing is out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1114;The pox to this infernal piece of meat crawling in your womb, stretching and destroying your body from the inside out! You cannot bear any of this any longer. You've snapped several times to courtiers and servants, even when you knew there was no good reason to do so, but you just can't help it any more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1114;Grmpfh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1116;The maiden apologized and tried to bring you back to your chambers, but you refused her hand and kept crying in the middle of the corridor until two servants dragged you away. It's the fourth attack this week , this tribulation has eroded all your will and left you a broken sobbing shell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1116;I'm an horrible person and a disgrace to my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1117;You've just realized today that, even with the pregnancy finally over, you've yet to stop your daily visits to the cellar. Although... it *has* become some sort of tradition by now and many courtiers do agree you've had a sunnier disposition since you started it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1117;No excuses: I cannot go on like this. I have to stop drinking so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1117;I've survived the labour: a little sip here and there won't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1118;You thought after the pregnancy you would go back being your usual self, but it seems you've... gained a little weight. It's not like you turned into a pig all of a sudden, but reverting back to your old diet has not been as easy as you thought it would be when you started stuffing yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1118;I'm not becoming a measly fat cow who does nothing but eat all day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1118;Eh, I may actually like being a little softer and rounder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1119;This morning you've flogged a kitchen boy yourself. He made you so angry... The poor thing didn't even cry, you had scared him so badly. Then you yelled at his mother too. Now, you don't even remember why you were mad at the boy in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1119;Take a deep breath, must calm myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1119;Then the brat better behave, that's what!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1120;You've spent the last two days secluded in your chambers, refusing any food, too tired to move and too ailing to answer to any plead. You've given all of yourself to bring forth a new life into the world and now you feel empty, useless, discarded, alone. What was the point of all that suffering and anguish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1120;I've managed this far, I can't give up now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1120;There is no point in going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1121;As days go by, you find harder to ignore how your wife seems to be letting herself go, ravaging meal after meal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1121;She might use a little moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1121;She can take care of herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1122;Outrageous! Your spouse just had the nerve to tell you you've put on too much weight and should start eating less, as if recovering from the pregnancy wasn't hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1122;He *is* right after all. I should try harder to stop eating so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1122;Fat?! I'll show him fat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1123;Every night your wife keeps going down in the cellar, drinking herself to sleep. It was bad enough during the pregnancy, but you hoped she would have grown out of this bad habit by now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1123;Maybe she needs a little more encouragement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1123;There's nothing wrong in a little bottle once in a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1124;Your husband seems to have noticed your nightly visits to the cellar, this morning he voiced his concern about having a drunk for a wife. He could have been a little more gentle, after all I've been through in the last months...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1124;He's right! Time to let go of the bottle forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1124;He should learn to enjoy himself a little and stop patronizing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1125;You hoped the solution would solve itself after the baby came out, but your wife's temper still remains a problem. You *could* try and tell her to calm a little...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1125;What could go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1125;Nah, not feeling suicidal today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1126;Your spouse, he *dared* to say you have a temper problem! After all you've done, he *dares* to complain, as if he has any right! Alright, maybe you've become a little touchy after all the pain and stress you were exposed to in the last months, but that's understandable! What did *he* do?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1126;Hmm... Perhaps I *do* have a temper problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1126;*Now* I really am angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1127;It's been months since you saw your wife really happy: she doesn't speak, she barely eats, never leaving her chambers unless she really has to. Every night you hear her crying in her sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1127;I can't bear to see her this way. I should talk to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1127;I really cannot stand this moaning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1128;Today your husband spoke with you. Or rather, at you, you weren't really in the mood for talking. He was very gentle and tried to make you come out again and eat with him on a private dinner. You didn't know what to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1128;I've suffered enough, perhaps it is my chance to be alive again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsins1128;I want nothing! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11129;Your dear wife has finally listened to your advice. In a few weeks she might be back into shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1129;Not that bad at all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11130;Every day that passes by, your wife keeps stuffing herself like a goose. So much for moderation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1130;Ugh, we will need a larger bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11131;I can't remember the last time you saw your wife drunk. She's recovered quite nicely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1131;Smells better too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11132;Surprisingly, even if she yelled at you when you talked about it, your wife seems to have been quite calm in the last days. She's treating everyone better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1132;What if she's just about to snap royally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11133;Damn it! You didn't even manage to make your case, she just snapped at you and tossed you over the stairs. In fact, you might have broken something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1133;Ouch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11134;It's such a relief to see your wife alive again! You were really starting to worry, but she finally managed to recover from the hard pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1134;Now, if only she could stop talking, for once in awhile...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11135;You don't know what to do with your wife any more: you can barely recognize her. All thin and pale, she looks like a ghost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsins1135;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11136;Your health has quickly fallen in the last few days, to the point that you can no longer leave your bedchambers. This pregnancy is not going to be an easy trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11137;Gods, tell us what shall be done of this woman...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11138;As you struggle in your sleep, you see a bleak plain, soaked in a foetid miasma. A large green blob is lording over you, with a greasy smile he lowers his putrid sceptre over your womb, reassuring you with honeyed words: "Don't worry, your Papa will protect your child.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11139;As you struggle in your sleep, you see a golden child spread its wings and fly towards you. Your joy is shattered when you realize it is clad in filth and indescribable creatures leer from its shadow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11140;As you struggle in your sleep, a vortex of damnation and unimaginable horrors opens above you, letting warped crows and vultures fly over your body, screeching in your ears and clawing at your belly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11141;As you struggle in your sleep, you find yourself lying in an endless battlefield, covered in shattered bones and skies lorded by bloody clouds. Warriors in daemonic armor fight above you, mercilessly crushing you into the ground, and your own unborn child starts clawing from the inside of your womb, eager to spill some blood for itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11145;Your condition has not seen any improvement, but for a couple of days you have enjoyed enough clarity of mind to think about how to help yourself get through this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11146;The doctor your servants managed to find does not look that competent: he spends a lot of time just touching and groping you like some sort of deviant and in the end he prescribes you some of the most disgusting herbs you have ever tasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11147;Your luck may has just changed for the better: your servants found a well renowned doctor. After giving a good look at you, the old man was quick to prescribe a well dosed series of leechings which, according to him, will surely remove all the sour humours from your body and restore your balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11148;The wiseman your servants called seems to know a lot of things about illnesses and ill fortunes, he doesn't even have to look at you to know what to do and, after a night spent brewing and chanting, he gives you a philtre that will surely ease your labour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11149;The old priest heeds fast to the call. He has already spent a few nights praying alongside you in your bedchambers, calling for divine help to facilitate the transition of the newborn child unto the world, and doesn't seem like he'll be getting tired of it any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11150;A couple of wrinkled old ladies come in a few days, as you requested. Their methods do not seem the most sound, but you are in no position to refuse any help right now and are forced to submit yourself to their poultices, philtres and massages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11151;Your servants return with a group of young and fair nuns from an obscure order claiming unparalleled skills in assisting childbirth. They seem competent and friendly, but you grow absent-minded the longer they stay, to the point that, when they start performing strange rituals and draw weird symbols on your belly, you are barely aware of what's happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11152;Your mind is not as clear as you'd wish, but you know enough of herbs and mixtures to brew something that should ease your pain and facilitate the birth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11153;Your hated liege has fallen into a most vulnerable stage as her pregnancy progresses in not the best of conditions. Perhaps this could be the chance you needed to remove her and try to take her rule...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11154;Almighty Gods, is the naughty regent successful?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11155;You set down the chalice of wine as your vision goes blurry. Usually it takes longer for you to fall asleep. And most of the time you don't feel that sudden heat in your chest. Only when you start choking, you glance at the face of your regent, poking from the door with a leering look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11156;Your plan worked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] choked on her own blood. You must make sure you are not linked to the nefarious deed, but the worst part is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11157;You are about to drink your usual glass of wine to help you sleep, but a sudden bout of retching holds you off for a couple of seconds. When you take the glass again, you smell something off in the wine fragrance. Just then you glimpse at the reflection of your regent ominously spying at you from the door with an expectant look in their eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11158;Your plan did not work: your liege somehow managed to smell the poison and see you. She screamed for help and her personal guards came in to arrest you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11159;Your plan did not work: your liege somehow managed to smell the poison and see you. She screamed for help and her personal guards came in to kill you on the spot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11160;This is the first night you finally have a peaceful sleep, which is why the sudden pressure on your face takes some time before alerting you. When you finally reach consciousness you have little air left. You struggle for a few seconds, trying to push the pillow away or grab your assailant's arms, but you accomplish nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11161;Your liege barely had the strength to put up a fight and she quickly succumbed as you finished your work and, after some good minutes, removed the pillow from her face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11162;You had thought for one night you would finally have a peaceful sleep, but the contents of your insides strongly disagreed. You were just about to stand up when you heard a rustle near your bed and open your eyes to see your regent holding a pillow, ready to smother you with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11163;Your plan did not work: your liege woke up before you could suffocate her and resisted your assault long enough for the guards to hear her screams and grab you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11164;Your plan did not work: your liege woke up before you could suffocate her and resisted your assault long enough for the guards to hear her screams and hack you to pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11165;It comes out of nowhere: you were just receiving a visit from your regent, informing you of the state of your demesne, when [FromFrom.GetHerHim] just unsheathed [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dagger and slit your throat with it. You try to call for help, but only manage to fill your lungs with blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11166;Your plan worked rather easily. You went to your liege and slit her throat out of nowhere, letting her choke helplessly in her own blood. Nobody heard anything, although the bed looks like a mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11167;You are just talking with your regent about the state of affairs when you see [FromFrom.GetHerHim] suspiciously flinch with his hand under his clothes. Taken by a sudden fear you leap forward, grabbing the arm holding the dagger before [FromFrom.GetSheHe] can bring it to bear, calling for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11168;Your plan did not work: somehow your liege managed to see the dagger and screamed for help. The guards charge in, dragging you away to the dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11169;Your plan did not work: somehow your liege managed to see the dagger and screamed for help. The guards charge in, dragging you away from the bedchambers while one of them already prepares to cut your head off where it won't soil the linens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11170;You turn again and again under your sheets, panting desperately for air, but you still feel like suffocating. Your throat has become dry and hurtful, making it even harder to find peace at every wheeze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11171;Your servants take the last bucket filled with vomit, but they are not fast enough to place the new one under your face. As you puke all over your bed, the stench provokes a new surge of nausea, making you shiver violently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11172;You tear another growth of hair from your chest, trying to stop yourself from scratching at your legs. Despite your best efforts, from a few days ago your skin has started producing repulsive and painful rashes and patches of disgusting fur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11173;You spit out the water, having your foodtaster try it too. As the pregnancy has progressed everything has started to taste progressively worse, to the point that now even the blandest of foods and beverages taste spoiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11174;The servants cover you yet another time as you stir under your sheets, sweating and shivering. With the fever tormenting you, you lose the sense of time. In fact you can barely tell if you are awake or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11175;As the pregnancy goes on, you've found harder to focus on anything. There's a lot of people attending to you, although you don't know why they should, nor why they sometimes call you [Root.GetTitle]. One of the oldest is just explaining how your mind has been clouded by the pain, he's also talking about a lot of people you never really heard about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11176;You wake cold-sweated in the night, with your heart beating wildly and your breath short. Your throat is already sore, but you still manage to scream your lungs out for help. When the guards come in, it still takes them some time to stop you screaming and, after another long tired check, they assure you once again that there is nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11177;The servants work restlessly around you, changing the sheets and brushing off blood and sweat from you, but there seems to be nothing left to do. You keep bleeding and are too weak to endure any more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11178;One of your servants offers a piece of bread, but you push it aside, disgusted. You barely have the strength to breathe, let alone chew, and the growing weight of your belly is making you feel nauseous at every turn, so much that it is becoming hard to make you eat anything at all for days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11179;You stir and drool, uncontrollably twisting in your bed, despite the best efforts of your servants to hold you still. You hear several worried and threatening voices, but everything is blurry and you yourself have no idea of what you keep screaming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11180;The servants change the sheets again as you scream and hold your belly, trying hopelessly to ease the pain of the excruciating cramps crossing your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11181;You let out a whimper when you feel a tooth on your tongue and you almost swallow it. You keep moaning through your closed mouth as you feel the metallic taste of blood fill your throat. More teeth are loosening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11182;The third servant girl falls asleep in the middle of her story as you stare at her, teeming with envy. It's been almost a weak since you last managed to properly sleep. Your eyes are bloodshot and your ears scream in pain at any sound louder than a whisper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11183;Some of the servants seem to be really starting to worry about you, but in truth, you haven't felt that bad at all the last few days. At least, not since the talking fox brought some of his friends in to entertain you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11184;You get startled when a pair of hands drags you back from the edge of the balcony. How did you even get there? The last thing you remember was trying to find the right position to sleep without squashing your belly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11185;At the beginning the pain was unbearable, but you think the situation has slightly improved since the past days. The cramps happen seldom and you've stopped shedding blood. You still have a lot of work ahead of you and the ordeal has left you severely weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11186;With the pregnancy finally over, you feel free from the heavy burden you carried for the past months. The worst has passed and you survived, but not without a cost: the trauma you have endured has left your body wrecked and weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11187;Congratulations! You're a vision baby!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11190;The pregnancy is over, but you have yet to leave your chambers, scourged by a terrible fever which is leaving you shivering and burning under your sheets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11191;As you turn in your bed, you find another lock of hair lying among the sheets. There's no doubt any more that the strain your pregnancy put you through is resulting in an alarming loss of hair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11192;Your bleeding has yet to stop. Even with the child out, you still experience frequent episodes of blood loss, despite the best efforts of your healers to stop the flow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11193;The horrific trial is finally over and you have withstood intact, re-emerging without any lasting scars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11194;You are finally starting to recover from the troubled pregnancy, but the ordeal left you exhausted and has seriously weakened your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11195;Although your body is recovering, the pain of the pregnancy has deeply scarred your mind. Every sound alarms you and you find harder to go outside of your rooms and perform normal tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11196;You thought it would be over with the child out of you, but the internal bleeding you've suffered has only worsened your condition. As you lay in your blood-soaked bed, the servants desperately try to preserve what little spark of life you have left, but to no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11197;Your wife went through an extremely painful pregnancy, but she seems to have miraculously recovered without any permanent damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11198;Your wife went through an extremely painful pregnancy, and while she managed to survive it, she has been left weakened and fragile from the ordeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11199;Your wife went through an extremely painful pregnancy and while she managed to survive it in the body, her mind was shattered by the hellish experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11200;Your wife did not survive her pregnancy, dying of complication after her labour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11201;Your wife is not enduring her labour as easily as one would expect. In fact, there seems to be actual danger of her not surviving the experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins11202;Now that you are pregnant, it might be a good time to designate a regent. You might be vulnerable in the next months and in need of someone trusted to look after the realm and yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1203;Your spouse's pregnancy is not proceeding well. The more days pass the more it looks like she may not survive the labour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1204;Your spouse has taken directly upon himself attending to you in these troubled days, putting to good use his skills to ease your pain and restore your health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1205;Your spouse has spent a lot of money to call for the best healers he could find to attend to you. Maybe not everything is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1206;As you cry and twist in your bed, there hasn't been a day without your spouse attending to you, trying to comfort you as much as he can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1207;Your spouse's attentions were miraculous: a lot of the pain is gone and you feel ready to endure the labour ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1208;While you are still weak, your spouse's attentions have been enough to partially restore your health, easing the challenge that awaits you some months from now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1209;Despite your spouse's best efforts, you are still confined into your bed, devastated by pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1210;Your work has paid off: your wife's health has been completely restored and she seems ready to endure the final stages of her pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsins1211;Your work has had some fruits, your wife does not appear as endangered as before, but she still remains very weak and further complications might arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1212;Despite your best efforts, your wife is still scourged by her illness, unable to move from her bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1213;Your liege's pregnancy is not proceeding well. The more days pass the more it looks like she may not survive the labour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1214;Your regent has taken directly upon [From.GetHerHim]self attending to you in these troubled days, putting to good use [From.GetHerHis] skills to ease your pain and restore your health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1215;Seeing your conditions worsening, your regent has decided to invest some of [From.GetHerHis] wealth to find knowledgeable healers to treat you in the coming months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1216;Since your pregnancy took the wrong turn, there hasn't been a day without your regent visiting you to check on your health and assure you that everything is going fine in your demesne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1217;Your regent's attentions were miraculous: a lot of the pain is gone and you feel ready to endure the labour ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1218;While you are still weak, your regent's attentions have been enough to let you survive through what you hope is the worst of this pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1219;Despite your regent's best efforts to ease your pregnancy, you are still confined into your bed, devastated by pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1220;Your work has paid off: your liege's health has been completely restored and she seems ready to endure the final stages of her pregnancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1221;Your work has had some fruits, your liege does not appear as endangered as before, but she still remains very weak and further complications might arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsins1222;Despite your best efforts, your liege is still scourged by her illness, unable to move from her bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsins11188;There's something wrong with your child. The sticky skin, the cysts, the yellow eyes, not quite an illness, something much worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsins11188;There's something wrong with your child. Blessed with eerily and otherworldly features, bordering between beautiful and disturbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsins11188;There's something wrong with your child, a lean screeching creature with small patches of strange skin and other unsettling traits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDsins11188;There's something wrong with your child, while the newborn appears mostly healthy, nobody seems to able to quell their screams and bursts of violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1136;Let it be over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1137;Mess with her head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1137;Let her call a priest or something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsins1137;Psst, Regent? Now's your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsins1137;Meh, just let her suffer, I don't care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1138;Help me through this, o gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1139;Stay away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1140;Stay away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1141;I too shall be victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1142;No! Let me out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1143;My son shall ride the heavens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1144;You shall not have me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1145;Search for the best healer in the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1145;I want a priest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsins1145;Search the villages for experienced midwives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsins1145;The pox on everyone! I'll do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1146;Bleah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1147;I can already feel less pain!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1148;Maybe it's working...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1149;Help me [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1150;Are you sure you know what you're doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1151;What are you doing?! Wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1152;It will work, I'm sure of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1153;A nice poison is the best option...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1153;I'll just wait for her to fall asleep and then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsins1153;She's weak, I'll just slit her throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsins1153;I will do no such thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1154;Poison, huh? Classic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1154;Pah, poison'll never work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsins1154;Beware the vorpal pillow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsins1154;Pfh, that only ever works for babies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1155;You...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1156;Now she rests in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1157;Guards! Seize [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1157;Guards! Kill [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1158;How could it fail?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1159;No! Wait! It's just a philtre!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1160;Hmmfmffhhh!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1161;Easier than smothering a child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1162;Guards! Seize [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1162;Guards! Kill [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1163;Stupid pillow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1164;No! Wait! I was just tidying it for her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1165;Glrgllch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1166;I should probably wash my hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1167;Guards! Seize [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1167;Guards! Kill [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1168;Maybe I should've gone with the pillow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1169;No! Wait! It's not what it seems!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1170;I can't breathe...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1171;Glkh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1172;What's happening to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1173;Is it poison?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1174;Help me! I'm burning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1175;I would really like to meet this [Root.GetFirstName], could you introduce us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1175;This [Root.GetFirstName] looks like a horrible person, I don't want [Root.GetHerHim] in my home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1176;I'm dying! Help me, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1177;I... feel... nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsins1180;The pain! It's unbearable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1181;Why!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1182;Stop walking! It feels like a earthquake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1183;Teh-eeh! That tickles, Lord Butterfly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1184;Where am I? What have you done?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1185;I think I'll just rest my eyes for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1186;It's finally over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1187;Yay! I'm vision baby!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1188;My child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1189;I'm just glad this is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1190;Why am I shaking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1191;What's happening to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1192;I will bleed out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsins1194;I think I'll rest another couple of days still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1195;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1196;I'll rest just a little more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1197;That's a relief. To when the next son?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsins1199;It can still manage another couple of toddlers, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1200;My darling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1201;That's unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1202;I'll think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1203;I can help her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsins1203;We can pay for the best healers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsins1203;Not much I can do, but I'll be beside her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsins1203;She'll figure things out on her own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1204;Are you sure you know what you're doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsins1205;They better be worth what they're paid...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
