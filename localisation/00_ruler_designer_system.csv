# RULER DESIGNER SYSTEM EVENTS

wh_rulerdesigner.2.desc;This is an event to choose whether your Undead Mummy boy/girl will be a Liche Priest and thus wield magic or a Tomb King. Also makes you a century older, so the other mummies stop laughing at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wh_rulerdesigner.4.desc;You chose the wrong religion - be it through console, a bug, or Ruler Designer. I'm here to help fix that. Non-Universal religions are on the next page.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wh_rulerdesigner.5.desc;This is just where you can choose your cultural pantheon, as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wh_rulerdesigner.6.desc;And your actual religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
