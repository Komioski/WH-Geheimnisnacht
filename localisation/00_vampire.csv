vampire_lahmian_visible;Lahmian Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_lahmian_visible_desc;Founded by Neferata, Queen of Lahmia and Firstborn Vampire, the Lahmian vampires are known for being sensual as well as vicious. Their beauty often blinds their foes to the danger that lurks behind the mask. Through a complex web of spies and intrigue, they shape the fate of many realms from the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_lahmian_hidden;Hidden Lahmian Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_lahmian_hidden_desc;This character is unusually beautiful and their pale skin makes them look like a marble statue. It is not surprising then that they are most active at evening dinner parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_carstein_visible;Carstein Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_carstein_visible_desc;Though their founder is unknown, many accounts point either towards Vashanesh, consort to Queen Neferata of Lahmia and distant relative of Nagash or to Vlad von Carstein himself. Vampires of the von Carstein bloodline are creatures of enormous passion, unbridled ambition and skilled equally in sword and sorcery. Their most trivial desires shape the destinies of entire nations, for they are the greatest of all the bloodlines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_carstein_hidden;Hidden Carstein Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_carstein_hidden_desc;What a nice fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_blood_visible;Blood Dragon Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_blood_visible_desc;Founded by Abhorash, Captain of the Guards of Lahmia, the Blood Dragons come mostly from the realm of Bretonnia. Their goal is to succeed in mastering combat, and obtaining the same ability of permanently suppressing the need to drink human blood through martial excellence, as Abhorash did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_blood_hidden;Hidden Blood Dragon Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_blood_hidden_desc;This character appears quite normal except for the pale features.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_strigoi_visible;Strigoi Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_strigoi_visible_desc;Founded by Ushoran, Lord of Masks and cousin to Queen Neferata of Lahmia, the Strigoi are hunched monstrosities, hulking creatures of muscle that barely have any human resemblance. They weren't always like this, and once ruled upon mighty Strygos, in what is now known as the Badlands. Generations of hiding in dark caves and feeding upon the flesh and blood of the dead has irreversibly transformed them into their actual, cursed shapes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_strigoi_hidden;Hidden Strigoi Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_strigoi_hidden_desc;This unfortunate fellow is extremely ugly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_necrarch_visible;Necrarch Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_necrarch_visible_desc;Founded by W'soran, High Priest of Lahmia, the Necrarch Vampires are gaunt, skeletal horrors, reeking of dead flesh and observing the world dispassionately with inhuman coldness. Seeking to master the arts of Necromancy, the Necrarchs typically live in secluded towers full of all kinds of twisted research and experiments - failed or otherwise. They have barely any need to feed on mortals, rather sustaining themselves through their dark arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_necrarch_hidden;Hidden Necrarch Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_necrarch_hidden_desc;This character must be suffering quietly from some terrible disease, what else could explain the rotting stench and bone-tight skin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_jade_visible;Jade Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_jade_visible_desc;Founded by Harakhte, Grand Vizier of Lahmia, the Jade Vampires are of alien manner and are enamoured with systems and patterns. They depend on the use of Dark Crystals and are the more prolific and aggressive amongst the bloodlines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

vampire_jade_hidden_desc;This character is always thinking about the world, so much so that they never seem to find time to eat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_mahtmasi_visible;Mahtmasi Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_mahtmasi_visible_desc;Founded by Maatmeses, Chief Executioner and Judge of Lahmia, the Mahtmasi Vampires are strange and mysterious beings, lurking in the darkness of the Southland jungles, midway between the world of the living and the Shadowlands. They are silent and undiscernable creatures very defensive of their followers and their land, who often appear as swarms of vermin or through shadows and curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_mahtmasi_hidden;Hidden Mahtmasi Vampire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vampire_mahtmasi_hidden_desc;This character can't seem to decide what they want in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# VAMPIRE EVENTS

EVTDESCVAMPIRE.0;As you are in your liege's court, your liege confront you one evening with a retinue of guards. 'It is time...' your vampire overlord says, '...for you to join me in the darkness...' you can't escape, there is no choice now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.1;This courtier has been turned into a loyal vampire minion now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.10;Your liege is a vampire, so why should you have to suffer and die as a mortal? Why not just join the ruling caste fully, and embrace the darkness in return for life eternal?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.11.a;First death, then eternal life, my new minion...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.11.b;First death, then eternal life, my new minion...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.11;One of your vassals has asked you for the dark gift, and swears eternal fealty if you would but grant this heartfelt desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.12;Your liege bestows the dark gift upon you, and bids you serve faithfully until the end of your days.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.13;Your liege refuses your request, saying that you are not worthy. Your skills are lacking, and you are too thoroughly unimpressive to join the illustrious ranks of the vampire aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.14.a;Make this vampire part of my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.14;You can make a vampire part of your own dynasty by giving him or her the minor title 'Vampire Heir Target' and then click on the event option below. Remember to remove the minor title after you have used it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.15;Your liege has decided to formally welcome you into his dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.16;You are a powerful ruler, it is time to make some heirs of your dynasty. You will scour the land for worthy candidates and then turn them and call them children.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.17;You are a powerful ruler, it is time to make some heirs of your dynasty. You will scour the land for worthy candidates and then turn them and call them children.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTVAMPIRE.2.b;No, do not bother me with this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.2;A character in your realm is particularly skilled, and might make a worthy recipient of the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.20;You are a powerful ruler, it is time to make some heirs of your dynasty. You will scour the land for worthy candidates and then turn them and call them children.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.3;You are summoned to a vampire lord's court. The way the invitation arrived, with no explanation, makes you pretty certain that you are going to be turned into a vampire if you go... it has happened before to others...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.4.a;First death, then eternal life, my new minion...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.4;Your guest arrives. It is time to bestow the dark gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.5;Word reaches you that your intended recipient for the dark gift has fled your realm, rather than become a vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.6.a;Yes, send an invitation to my court...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.6.b;No, do not bother me with this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.6;It is often safest to have your highest ranked vassals become vampires themselves, so that they know that their fortunes are tied to your own success. Do you want to start turning your most powerful vassals?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTVAMPIRE.7.b;Never! I will fight for my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.7;You are summoned to your vampire liege's court. The way the invitation arrived, with no explanation, makes you pretty certain that you are going to be turned into a vampire if you go... it has happened before to others...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCVAMPIRE.9;Your vassal has refused your invitation, sending word: 'I will fight to the death, rather than submit to your eternal curse!';;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.21;While unlife certainly has its benefits, the being under the thumb of your vampiric "fatheris not one of them. After various indignities, your resentment has finally reached a tipping point.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIRE.22;While unlife certainly has its benefits, the being under the thumb of your vampiric "motheris not one of them. After various indignities, your resentment has finally reached a tipping point.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.0;When you meet [FromFrom.GetFirstName] in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] room, the reason for your summoning becomes clear: [GetFromFromRelation] wishes to turn you into [From.GetHerHis] thrall and share your friendship forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.0;You meet with [FromFrom.GetFirstName] under the pale moonlight and before [FromFrom.GetSheHe] can even speak, you know what [FromFrom.GetSheHe]'s about to ask: your [GetFromFromRelation] wishes you to share in [FromFrom.GetHerHis] love for all eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.0;Your [GetFromFromRelation] has called you to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] rooms and is now ordering you to lay down. It appears [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has decided to honour you with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire0;Kiss me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBvampire0;I will never be like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCvampire0;No! Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCVAMPIREC.11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, wishing to share your love for eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has asked you for the dark gift, stating [From.GetSheHe] could not bear the thought of death ending your shared bond and forcing [From.GetSheHe] to leave you alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREA.12;Your [GetFromRelation] bestows the dark gift upon you, and bids you serve [From.GetHerHim] faithfully until the end of your days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREB.12;The bounds of friendship will outlast the fickle nature of life, at least for what concerns you and [From.GetFirstName]. Your [GetFromRelation] has agreed to grant you the dark gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIREC.12;Death shall not part you and [From.GetFirstName]: once [From.GetSheHe] has bestowed upon you [From.GetHerHis] dark blessing, you awake as preternatural creature of the night, to be at [From.GetHerHis] side forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRED.12;Love will conquer death itself: [From.GetFirstName] gave you the dark kiss and you are now bound together as immortal souls, forever sharing your passion for each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBVAMPIRE15;I have no desire to join this bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has refused your request to take [From.GetHerHis] place within your coven, thus staining your reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150001;A fledgling disobeying [Root.GetHerHis] Sire?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE15002;One of your fledglings, [FromFrom.GetFirstName], has come to you asking to fully join your coven and be recognized as a member of your ancestral bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150002;We accept you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBVAMPIRE150002;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCVAMPIRE150002;You shall never be of this coven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150003;Your sire [From.GetFirstName] has denied you your request. While the same blood runs through your veins, you're yet to be recognized as part of the coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150003;My time will come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150004;Your sire [From.GetFirstName] has denied you your request. While the same blood runs through your veins, you're yet to be recognized as part of the coven. And by heeding [From.GetHerHim], you might never be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150004;My time will come... one way or another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has accepted your request and allowed you to fully join in [From.GetHerHis] dark coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE150006;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has gracefully accepted your offer and joined fully in your ancient coven, completely identifying with your bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE150006;As [From.GetSheHe] should have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.2;Your sire has fully accepted you as a member of their coven, yet you've still to receive a proper title within the household's possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.2;I will ask what is my right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.2;I can wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has come to you requesting a formal recognition by granting [From.GetHerHim] rulership over a part of your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.3;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.3;I shall decide when it is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.4;[From.GetFirstName] has granted your wish and bestowed upon you a holding to rule in the name of [From.GetHerHis] coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.4;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.5;[From.GetFirstName] has denied your wish, berating you for trying to give [From.GetHerHim] commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.5;But I deserve this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires8;Your [GetFromFromRelation] calls for you with a gentle tone, but when you near [FromFrom.GetHerHim] you realize too late that the dark creature has decided to feast upon your blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires8;No! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires9;There truly is nothing more delicious than virgin blood. Your [GetFromRelation] has left the world of the living and joined you as child of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires9;Good for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires10;As the blood of the sacrifice runs across the altar, you feel the Wind of Death blow stronger. Another step closer to your ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires10;Yes. We need more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires11;You are ready to perform your necromantic ritual. The greater the power you will commit, the greater the horde which will be raised from the grave to obey your commands. At least, until they fall apart once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11;All shall fall and serve me in death!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires11;A great host to bring fear to my enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires11;A large horde to serve my every need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires11;A small horde, nothing excessive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEsvampires11;Only a few servants for my personal needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11001;Once the spell has been completed, a few hundred skeletons and zombies gather before you, ready to obey your every order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11002;Once the spell has been completed, a few hundred skeletons and zombies gather before you, ready to obey your every order. Looking at them, they seem to be a little more numerous than you expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11002;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11003;Once the spell has been completed, thousands of skeletons and other undead gather before you, ready to obey your every order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11003;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11004;Once the spell has been completed, a few thousand skeletons and other undead gather before you, ready to obey your every order. Looking at them, they seem to be a little more numerous than you expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11004;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11005;A great collection of undead of every kind assembles before you, answering your call. The ritual has bore a wonderful harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11006;A great collection of undead of every kind assembles before you, answering your call. The ritual has bore a great harvest. They seem more numerous than you expected, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11006;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires12001;Your horde of undead finally falls apart, devoid once more of any semblance of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11007;Once your ritual ends all of the land before you has withered and a great host of undead has risen, filling the fields, ready to do your bidding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11007;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11008;Once your ritual ends all of the land before you has withered and a great host of undead has risen, filling the fields, ready to do your bidding. They are so many, you can barely see the ground on which they walk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11008;All the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11009;Only the Great Necromancer himself could have outdone such a feat: you've sucked all life from this land and through your great ritual an endless horde of corpses has arisen to follow your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11009;To war, my minions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires11010;Only the Great Necromancer himself could have outdone such a feat: you've sucked all life from this land and through your great ritual an endless horde of corpses has arisen to follow your whims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires11010;To war, my minions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14;You've studied [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s routine for some time and believe you could hire an agent to slip through to [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] resting place and steal the ring at the right moment...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14;My co-conspirators will provide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14;I'll take proper precautions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires14;We need an experienced burglar for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires14;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14001;This might be the right time. A good thief could sneak and steal the ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14001;Ask the Plot head for funds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14001;I'll take the proper precautions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires14001;We need an experienced burglar for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires14001;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14002;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is asking for funds to hire a thief in order to steal [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring while [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] is resting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14002;Very well - too bad I will not see it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14002;Even [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] death is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14003;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me the necessary funds to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14004;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to fund the master thief needed to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14004;I will pay for it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14004;Forget it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14005;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, the one true time when you look no different from a corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14005;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires14005;And yet.. I feel someone's touch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14006;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. The vile man has fled the room once you finally awake, but you've smelled his scent before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14006;A million deaths for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14007;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, you can only feel the touch of the thief once he's long gone, along with your ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14007;My ring! My ring!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14008;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. With a sudden gesture your claws snap at his neck, raising the pathetic mortal from the ground and holding him still until he whispers terrified the name of his employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14008;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]? So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14009;There are no dreams accompanying your rest during daylight, only the stillness of full death, but you can still feel the thief's touch on your hand. With a sudden gesture your claws snap at his neck, but the wretched mortal is fast enough to flee, albeit empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14009;Who could have sent him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14010;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let me know that [From.GetSheHe] has finally found a man skilled and brave enough to try and steal [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14010;He better not screw this up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14011;[From.GetTitledName] approves of your idea to hire an agent to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14011;Make the preparations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14012;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to steal [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring is proceeding well. The thief will act on [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHim] while [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] rests within one month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14012;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14013;Success! [From.GetTitledName]'s ring is in your hands. Unfortunately, your complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14013;Good. But... bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14014;Success! That thief was really as skilled as he boasted. [From.GetTitledName] has lost [From.GetHerHis] ring and knows nothing of your involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14014;And now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14015;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] captured the thief and squeezed your name out of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14015;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14016;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] woke before the thief could steal the ring, but my complicity has not been revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14016;We will just have to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14010;Tell [This.GetTitledName] of the idea to steal [This.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14002;Ask [This.GetTitledName] for funds to steal [This.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ring;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14003;[This.GetTitledName] receives the funds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14004;Inform [This.GetTitledName] that I will not pay;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14005;Steal [This.GetTitledName]'s ring during [This.GetHerHis] rest next month;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPsvampires14011;Approve the plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires13001;The dreaded ring of [From.GetFirstName] now lies within your hands. Through this wicked artifact [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been able to return from death time and again. Legend has it any vampire could master such a power by wearing this trinket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires13001;And it is MINE now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires13001;I will make sure nobody will ever see this thing again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires13002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has wrested control over the powerful Carstein Ring and now rules over [From.GetHerHis] undead hordes backed by its promise of immortality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires13002;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires14017;It has been days now, but still no trace of the thief. The wretched scum must have fled who knows where with your ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires14017;A thousand curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires16;The dreaded Red Duke has risen once again, to claim his rule over Aquitaine and all of Bretonnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires16;Follow me to war, brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires16;I will bide my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires17;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered new fledglings to increase the size of [From.GetHerHis] host, bringing prestige to your name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires17;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires18;In your long quest for perfection you've defeated countless enemies and ravaged entire provinces. In this search, your men collected several trinkets. It is only right to send some of them to the Master of your Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires18;They have no value to me anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires18005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has quested long and hard, honing [From.GetHerHis] skills in [From.GetHerHis] search for perfection. Although of little value to your Order, [From.GetSheHe] has sent part of [From.GetHerHis] spoils of war as tribute in your honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires18005;Trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires19001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tricked you: the fiend is nothing but a Prince of Darkness and has now taken [event_target:eloper.GetFirstName] away from you, turning it into an unliving abomination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires19001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tricked you, the vampire has seen something in [event_target:eloper.GetFirstName] and snatched [event_target:eloper.GetHerHim] away from you, turning it into [From.GetHerHis] fledgling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires19001;[From.GetSheHe] could have asked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires19001;How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires19002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found some young talented mortal to join From.GetHerHis] ranks and turned the human into another member of the Order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires19002;It better be very talented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires20;The Blood Dragons have deployed their mindless and relentless servants to permanently occupy the province of [Root.GetName], if the county is not freed soon, a new enemy fortress shall rise within your very borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires20;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires21;The Blood Dragons in [Root.GetName], have completed their work: a dreaded fortress stands within your lands, housing new undead forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsblooddragons23;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI call you, who claim to have valor and skill, to join me in a daring quest ashore.

EVTOPTAsblooddragons23001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons24;It has been a good sport, but it has now come the time for you to go home and meditate on your accomplishments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons24;We've had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons24001;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI feel tired from all this aimless slaughter and have come to the decision of leaving this host. When you'll receive this message I'll be long gone and on my way home.\n\nGood hunting\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsblooddragons24002;We've had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons25001;With [From.GetTitledFirstName] dead, the Blood Quest is without a leader. One by one, the knights disband, returning to their hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsblooddragons27;Do you wish to remain in this land, or venture forth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsblooddragons27002;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest in the restless Border Princedoms. The countless armies of petty warlords and greenskin savages should provide a good sport for all of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27003;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the snowy plains of Kislev, hoping to track down some of the northern great beasts or find good sport in one of the nomadic tribes roaming the borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27004;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsblooddragons27006;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the southern realms of Myrmidia. These warm plains scourged by discontented peasants and petty Princes could hold a proper challenge for all of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27006;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27007;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the ancient borders of Strygos. This barren wasteland scourged by greenskins and other pathetic creatures will crumble under your hooves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27007;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27008;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to Araby, a land of mystics, scourging hot sun and vast deserts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsblooddragons27009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to the mysterious lands of Nehekhara, the ancestral home of all Vampires. Once more, the descendants of Lahmia will fight against the rotting corpses of Khemri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27009;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27010;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to move the Blood Quest to cold shores of Norsca, riddled with hordes of superstitious and warmongering barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27010;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27011;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host beneath the ground, exploring the long-abandoned underground tunnels of the Dwarfs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27011;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27012;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host in the far East, exploring the goblin-riddled plains known as Darklands, where only the merciless fist of the Dawi Zharr stands against unfettered anarchy and destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27012;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27013;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host in the ancestral homeland of the Elves, Ulthuan. The elusive island, protected by ancient spells and defended by skilled elven warriors is sure to put up a fearsome fight against your incursion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27013;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27014;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host in the deadly and poisonous jungles of Lustria. All sorts of exotic and dangerous creatures crawl under the tight leaves of this ancient land, each would make an excellent game for any of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27014;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27015;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host to the Land of the Chill, home to the cruel Dark Elves. Skilled in magic and murder, the Druchii are certain to be a great challenge for your blades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27015;We ride in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons27016;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host to the intricate and mysterious forest of Athel Loren. Strange and unknowable creatures hide between those ancient trees and the elusive Wood Elves are known to fiercely defend them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsblooddragons27018;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to lead the host oversea, challenging the great ocean to reach strange and new challenge for you to meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons27018;We soar in death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29;There was no doubt about it from hours before you finally sight the warband in the distance: greenskins. Their stench filled your blackened lungs from miles away. There's hardly any test of resolution against a bloodless foe, but they should at least put up a decent fight for your host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29;Let's prepare for battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29;We'll ride around, they're not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29001;Your leader has caught the scent of a greenskin band and decided to engage them. There's hardly any test of resolution against a bloodless foe, but they should at least put up a decent fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29001;I'll partake in this skirmish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29001;This is beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29002;The greenskins are still far away, you're quite certain their dim senses have yet to allow them to perceive you. The orcs and goblins are marching in the distance, moving from a hill towards your host and outnumber you greatly, but their brute force should be no match for your knights' skill and determination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29002;I shall fly and lead a strike on them from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29002;We can lure them down before attacking and half their advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsblooddragons29002;We will flank them and crush them from the sides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsblooddragons29002;We will charge them in a frontal assault.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls you and the other knights for an aeral assault on the greenskins. You spur your winged steed, following [From.GetHerHis] lead. You fall down upon the unsuspecting orcs, trampling and slashing greenskins left and right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsblooddragons29003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] calls some of the knights for an aeral assault on the greenskins. As for you and the other land-bound knights, you have to join the fray later on, charging the greenskins as they are caught by surprise from above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29003;Die, foul creatures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29004;You fly off with some of the nights, while the others await down for the signal. Soaring beyond the clouds, with sunlight boiling over your stealplate, you dive down onto the greenskins, trampling them and slashing their stiff flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29004;Your end has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sends you with half of the knights ahead to lure the greenskins down. It's not hard to taunt the beasts into charging down the hill. Once they lose their momentum, [From.GetFirstName] springs the ambush, charging out of the slope as you turn to face the savages as well, along with the rest of your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29005;Stupid savages, your end is nigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29006;You send half of the host ahead, taunting the orcs to charge down the hill while you find cover behind a slope. It's not hard for the others to taunt them in a charge and once the greenskins have lost their momentum, you come out of your hiding spot, leading an assault from behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29006;Stupid savages, your end is nigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29007;[From.GetTitledFirstName]divides the host, ordering a charge from the sides, to flank and crush the pathetic greenskins. The orcs spot you as you ride over the hill, roaring in anticipation for the fight, carelessly running towards both parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29007;Mindless beasts, die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAsblooddragons29008;Mindless beasts, die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29009;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shouts, calling for a frontal charge against the greenskin foe. You spur your steed uphill, quickly gaining thrust alongside the other knights and smashing into the gleeful horde of orcs and goblins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29009;DIE!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsblooddragons29010;You shout, calling for a frontal charge against the greenskin foe. You spur your steed uphill, quickly gaining thrust alongside the other knights and smashing into the gleeful horde of orcs and goblins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29010;DIE!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29011;Dozens of orcs fall before the greenskin's thirst for battle is overcome by their cowardice. The broken remnants of the warband flee back towards the hill, trying to escape the cold steel of your lances and swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29011;Pursue them, wipe that pathetic scum from the face of the Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsblooddragons29011;Pursue and capture those wreck for our amusement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsblooddragons29011;Let the weak flee before our might! We're done here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29012;One after the other, you cut down the pitiful greenskins, but their numbers and determination are too great: the savages keep on fighting, slowly turning the tide. Finally, your steed falls over, cut down by dozen of goblins and a huge orc bears his hammer down upon your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29012;No!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29013;Dozens of orcs fall before the greenskin's thirst for battle is overcome by their cowardice. The broken remnants of the warband flee back towards the hill, trying to escape the cold steel of your lances and swords. [From.GetFirstName] finally declares victory, standing upon their broken carcasses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29013;Yahh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29014;You knights have an easy time reaching and cutting down the remainder of the warband. Their heads roll down the hill, cementing your ultimate victory over this foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29014;None stands in the way of the Blood Dragons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29015;Despite their zeal, your knights can only take some of the cowards' lives before the orcs finally disappear in a nearby wood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29015;Pests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsblooddragons29016;Once the  survivors are rounded up, you spend a couple of hours having your fun torturing a few. A couple of them, perhaps believing a purpose to be in your entertainment, shout the name of some stashed loot nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsblooddragons29016;Deluded fools. Still, no reason to let it waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires23;Just like moths circling towards the light, a band of ghouls and minor undead has shambled its way to your dominion, instinctively seeking the guide of an aristocrat of the night such as yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires23;More servants are always welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires23;Those revolting carcasses are beneath my needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.26;You've waited too long. The adventurers and nomadic Strygan tribes gathered under your banner have slowly lost interest and left, leaving you with too little troops to attempt the reconquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.26;You've waited too long. The shambling bands of ghouls gathered under your will have devolved into petty infighting out of starvation, tearing each other apart to the point you have too little troops to attempt an invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.26;Next time... next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.27;A great caravan comes into your capital, led by several warriors of the Badlands who heard of your plans and have decided to join you on your quest for your old homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.27;Slowly but surely a great deal of ghouls has started to flock the lands over your cove, lured by the silent call they cannot resist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.27;Come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.28;Your name is well remembered by the old aristocrats of Strygos and, albeit your bloodline is by nature reclusive, your renown was enough to lead another Strigoi to your cove, ready to pledge allegiance to you and follow you in your conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.28;Your name is well remembered by the old aristocrats of Strygos and, albeit your bloodline is by nature reclusive, your renown was enough to lead another Strigoi to your cove, ready to pledge allegiance to you and follow you in your conquest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.28;Welcome, brother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_svampires.29;Little by little, warriors and adventurers have come to your capital, eagerly awaiting for the war to reclaim their ancestors's homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_svampires.29;Little by little, the ghouls and Strigany come to you, flocking your land and awaiting your command to march against the usurpers of your ancestral realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.29;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires31;You never doubted it, you knew this day would have come, you knew you would have been the one to reclaim Strygos. With the core regions firmly under your control, nobody can deny your great empire is nearly restored. The hordes of savage greenskins and the pitiful armies of the mortals or the trickery of the accursed Lahmians could do nothing but slow down the inevitable.\n\n Strygos has returned to life, with you as its rightful monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires31;I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires31001;Only legends talk about the wonders and the greatness of old Strygos. Never you could have dreamed one such as yourself could restore the realm of the immortals. And yet, here you are, holding the power once kept by the Tomb Princes, now wrestled by your hand from the savage greenskins.\n\n Strygos has risen once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires31001;A new age starts for our people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires310002;Despite your trickery and plots, the pitiful humans descendants of the old Strygos have reclaimed their homeland, one of them even having the gall to call [From.GetHerHim]self King of that accursed and misforgotten realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires310002;For millennia the Lahmians has hindered and hunted down the pathetic remnants of Ushoran's bloodline and yet the Strigoi have finally prevailed: a perveted flesh-eater rules over the Badlands, fancying [From.GetHerHim]self monarch of Strygos. Never were you so angered and embarassed at your failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires310002;Curse them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires310003;You had long dreamed for this moment, yet the resurgence of Strygos couldn't have come from a more unexpected source: it was not one of Ushoran's bloodline, but a humble mortal, a wandering Strigany, to restore the old realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires310003;You had long dreamed for this moment and although you'd have wished to be the one restoring Strygos, you can find solance knowing the blood of Ushoran reigns once more in Morukain, demanding the proper respect over all the Badlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires310003;I wish to join this Strygos reborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires310003;This is but another fleeting dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32;A great caravan of Strigany has come to the gates of your capital. Although the gypsies wear strange clothes and talk a strange dialect, they seem quiet and well-intentioned. They bring weird craft and exotic spices from afar to be sold within your walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32;They are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires32;I don't want their kind here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32001;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has returned empty-handed from the expedition. It appears none of the lands [FromFrom.GetSheHe] visited would welcome Strigany merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32001;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32002;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI bring good tidings from [From.Location.GetName], we've been accepted by the locals and started selling our wares. \n\nI've sent some of our profit along with this missive\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32002;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32003;Your merchants have sold lots of wares and made good profit this season. You will be greatly welcomed as you return to your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32003;Let's ride home, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires33003;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI bring you great wealth and craft [From.Location.GetName], where our merchants have sold most of our products this season. \n\nAs customary, I bring forth your share of the profits\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires33003;Good. Keep travelling there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires33003;This will be enough for that place. I want you here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires33;The Strigany merchants have packed their tents and removed themselves from your capital, probably for good this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires33;It was about time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32004;Your merchants have sold some wares and made a decent profit this season. You will be welcomed as you return to your liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32004;Let's ride home, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires34004;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI bring you wealth and craft [From.Location.GetName], where our merchants have sold a good part of our products this season. \n\nAs customary, I bring forth your share of the profits\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires34004;Good. Keep travelling there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires34004;This will be enough for that place. I want you here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32005;There has been a series of accidents and misunderstanding earning you the hate of the locals. You've had therefore not make good profit this season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32005;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires35004;There's been some miscontent within your capital in the past few months. The locals seem to have grown tired of the Strigany wandering about their homes, taking up their places in the market and, according to some reports, performing dark rituals in the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires35004;Those gypsies are nothing but trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires35005;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI regret to inform you our travel to [From.Location.GetName] has not been as successful as expected. A series of accidents and misunderstandings have earned us the hate of the locals, making it difficult for our merchants to sell their wares. \n\nPerhaps it might be better to change our destination for the next season\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires35005;No, keep travelling there. They'll get used to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires35005;A good suggestion. Stay here for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32006;The bigotry and hate of the locals drove them to openly attack your merchants. You are forced to return home without any of your products sold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32006;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires36004;The people in the capital have grown tired of the Strigany. Made fearful by their strange customs and dark rituals, they've risen up and openly attacked the merchants, driving them away from your city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires36004;Probably it's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires36006;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nI regret to inform you our travel to [From.Location.GetName] has been ill-fated. The locals, enflamed by our mere appearance, have driven us out of the city in a few days, preventing us from selling any of our wares. \n\nWe are no longer welcomed in this realm for some time,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires36006;That's inconvenient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires32007;Your great skills as a leader and a merchant has led your caravan to build a proper colony in these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires32007;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires37007;Your leniency in the past years might have been ill-advised. The community of Strigany has become so large to have claimed some of your lands, building a stable tribe there from which their caravans pass through each season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires37007;That's... not something I ordered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires37008;Esteemed [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n\nOur perseverance has paid off. No longer we are mere travellers in [From.Location.GetName] a stable Strygan outpost has been built in the past years as more of our people flocked in to share in our profits.\n\nWe pledge ourselves under your protection as I take charge of this post, with your blessing,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires37008;Great news indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires38;With Strygos reformed, you have the chance to restore the old Kingdom to its true glory. Should you push for the return of the old laws and customs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires38;Yes, Strygos shall be as it were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires38;No, this is a new Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires39;The Strigany in [Root.GetName] have slowly settled permanently in their old lands, taking the old customs of their forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires39;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires40;More Strigany are flocking every month in [Root.GetName], colonizing once more their ancestral homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires40;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires43;Your minions have broken the defenses of [From.GetName]. Even now they move forward to round up the local population. What should be done with the mortals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires43;Kill them all. Destroy everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires43;They'll make good subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires43;I do not care about these.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires44;[From.GetFirstName] has sent [From.GetHerHis] vile minions to destroy the province of [FromFrom.GetName], leaving nothing but tainted rubble, marked with the repulsive stench of undeath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires44;Blasted abominations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires45;[From.GetFirstName] has sent [From.GetHerHis] vile minions to destroy the province of [FromFrom.GetName], kidnapping dozens of families to be subjected to [From.GetHerHis] vile experiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires45;Blasted abominations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires46;[From.GetFirstName] has sent [From.GetHerHis] vile minions to destroy the province of [FromFrom.GetName], many of the survivors of the attack are already flocking your gates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires46;Blasted abominations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47;You have some spare subjects in your dungeons. How would you employ them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47;They are good samples for my personal studies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires47;They can be repurposed to serve me forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires47;Keep them there for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47001;As the blood of the last subject runs dry, you have concluded one of the most successful sessions of study you've had in quite some time. Experimenting on the pitiful mortals has given you a deeper understanding of the dark art of Nagash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47001;Another good night of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47002;Subject after subject, you twist and break the bodies and souls of your victims, looking at their entrails, recording the pitch of their screams, trying and dispelling incantations one after the other. In the end, you feel satisifed with your results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47002;Another good night of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47003;Subject after subject, you twist and break the bodies and souls of your victims, looking at their entrails, recording the pitch of their screams, trying and dispelling incantations one after the other. The results might not be as good as you hoped for, but you're still adequately satisfied with yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47003;Another good night of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47004;Subject after subject, you twist and break the bodies and souls of your victims, looking at their entrails, recording the pitch of their screams, trying and dispelling incantations one after the other. Sadly, this batch of mortals was not as enlightening as one would have hoped and your night ends in mild frustration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47004;Next time will be better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47005;Once you're done with them, the resulting minions have no resemblance to the subjects they once were. Such was the power and the skill you put on your work, they've been utterly transformed into loyal and terrifying creatures of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47005;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47006;You've had to discard several damaged subjects, but those who survived have now no resemblance to the subjects they once were. Such was the power and the skill you put on your work, they've been utterly transformed into loyal and terrifying creatures of the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47006;Magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47007;Your original draft might have been too ambitious or, more likely, your subjects defective. The result of your experiment was a pack of ravenous and gibberish humanoids, still useful in a way, but nothing as grand and terrifying as you hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47007;Next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires47008;Your original draft might have been too ambitious or, more likely, your subjects defective. None of them managed to stay alive until the end. They'll at least be decent undead slaves, if nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires47008;Better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires49;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent some of [From.GetHerHis] minions pleading for you to put your vast magical expertise into [From.GetHerHis] temporary employ and craft a magic item for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires49;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires49;I do not make trinckets for ones such as you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires50;[From.GetFirstName] has decided it would not be in [From.GetHerHis] best interest to craft a magic item for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires50;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60;The poison of the Dragon-Emperor is drying your blood. As more and more time passes since you've stared into the Dark Crystal, you feel your mind slipping into madness and your body collapsing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60;I will gaze into the Jade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires60;I don't need help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60005;You slither into the dark room and your eyes are soon caught by the sickly green glow of the black sphere standing on the pedestal. You are drawn closer to it and stare for days at its dark and smooth surface, letting its unholy power refill your body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60005;I am reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60007;It took you a while to realize it, but you've discovered some percious artifacts have disappeared from your treasury. As far as your servants remember, they swear you ordered the items shipped to an unknown location days ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60007;Grmmmhhh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60008;There is an important matter that requires your attention. You're uncertain how long it will take, but you feel compelled to depart immediately, alongside your servants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60008;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires70001;Your mission brought you far away from your palace, but it's finally over and you feel free to return to the usual business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires70001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires70002;Your mission brought you far away from your palace and to many dangerous places. When you come to your senses, you're in unknown land, grievously injured and barely manage to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires70002;Rrrgh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires70003;Your mission brought you far away from your palace and to many dangerous places and revealed itself to be too much for you to handle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires70003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60010;In your mediation your stare cut through the veil of the Dark Crystal itself. You saw the slopes of the Imperial City, the seat from which the Heavenly-Dragons rule over their subjects. Your will truly is divine, for you've catched a glimpse of their power and made it yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60010;I command the Heavensss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60011;You stared deeply into the Dark Crystal and as your power was restored, you glimpsed beyond its veil at wonders beyond the understanding of mortals. There is much to be learned from these ancient artifacts and you are one step closer to unlock their secrets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60011;The sssound of the universe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60012;You stared deeply into the Dark Crystal and as your power was restored, you glimpsed beyond its veil and saw the lair of the Firebringer. Wandering in the dreams of the ancient dragon, you stared at his works and new wonders were unlocked in your mind as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60012;Cogs and contraptions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60013;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge bursts through your body, leaving you wrecked on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60013;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60014;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge whips your mind, merging thoughts and stealing memories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60014;Aaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60015;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge overwhelms your mind, distorting your perceptions and breaking your senses. You leave the room screaming nonsense and pulling your hair off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60015;The great wyrms see me!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60016;You stared for too long in the poisonous depths of the Dark Crystal. The flow of forbidden knowledge bursts through your body, consuming your mind and turning your flesh into a bright steeming light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60016;AaaaaAAAAHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60017;You starved yourself in your meditation, staring in the depths of the Dark Crystal. In these past days you've seen wondrous and terrible things that you would have never believed in before. You've seen the real gods in their Heavenly Palace across the clouds, there is no denying they are the only creatures worthy of service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60017;For henceforth I pledge myself to the Heavenly Dragons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires71;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] wraps [FromFrom.GetHerHis] coils around you and stares into your eyes, slowly hissing. The unflinching reptilian stare of the Jade pierces into your mind, trying to bend it to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires71;Must.. resist..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires71001;The Jade have fed aplenty upon the worthless inhabitants of [Root.GetName]. The victims have been so many that servants and workers have become rare and the work has slown down there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires71001;How long before those inssects breed some more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires71002;The unsufferable mortals in [Root.GetName] still oppose your dominion over them. The incessant resistance to the Jade's many feasts have further enflamed the spirits there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires71002;They'll learn, one way or another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72;Is it time once more to feast over the flocks of unworthy mortals, rounding them up, relocating some for further breeding and suck the rest dry in a orderly fashion, as dictated by the rituals of the Imperial Scribe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72;Yesss, let us proceed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires72;Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72005;No city, fortress or village is left untouched. The swarms of Jade vampires circle around the province, tighteining their coils on any inhabitant they can find, bleeding dry some, turning the most promising and ensnaring the rest to relocate in their palaces as pets and slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72005;The rituals have been upheld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72006;No city, fortress or village is left untouched. The swarms of Jade Vampires circle around the province, tighteining their coils on any inhabitant they can find, bleeding dry some, turning the most promising and ensnaring the rest to relocate in their palaces as pets and slaves. This entire land lies empty now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72006;We'll send the lizardss to fill the void sssoon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72007;This province seems to offer more resistance than others. Villages have been abandoned before your arrival, villagers attack your guards, try to ambush you during the day, soon you discover this feast has turned into an uprising against your just rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72007;To armsss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires72008;[FromFromFrom.GetName] has been devoided of anyone for some time, but you finally managed to spare enough sauri to set up a garrison of sorts there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires72008;Until they are also required to sate our thirst;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires73;You've broken the defenses of [From.GetName], this province is filled with healthy cattle and several Jade are eager to take their due from the conquered population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires73;Have at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires73;Not here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires73001;The merciless undead of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have come to your lands and slaughtered your people. Soldier or commoner is of no difference for them and the few who have not been sucked dry have been enslaved and deported to their mysterious palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires73001;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires73002;The merciless undead of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have come to [FromFrom.GetName] and slaughtered its people. Soldier or commoner is of no difference for them and the few who have not been sucked dry have been enslaved and deported to their mysterious palaces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires73002;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires74;You've been searching for it for centuries and now you can bask once more in the greenish light of its dark surface. A Dark Crystal for you to stare at once more, to look at the Heavens as you did when you were there, so many centuries ago, and hear the thundering commands of the Dragon Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires74;No longer will your perfect form be ravaged by the twisted curse of the humans: you've found one of the lost Dark Crystals. Through it, you can tap once more in the power of the Heavens and snatch away what is rightfully yours from the greedy pawns of the Celestial Dragons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsvampires74;This is a day of celebrations. After many generations of search, you've found one of the lost Crystals of the Heavens. This relic will bring much honor to your family and endear the Celestial Dragons to your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDsvampires74;You've spent years searching for it and now it is finally within your grasp: one of the ancient Dark Crystals of Cathay. The fabled jade stone is smooth and pitch black, but a sickly green halo surrounds it, vibrant of the power contained within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires74;Mine at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires74001;News have reached you, that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has found one of the fabled Dark Crystals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires74001;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires75;You lose yourself in the dark reflections of the crystals and soon enough the voices of the Celestial Dragons thunder inside your mind. You must proceed further with your sacred duty. Due to your survival and reaffirmed fealthy to the Celestial Throne, you've been granted the lead over a new expedition which shall soon reach your colony. It is your task to proceed further inside Lustria and vanquish the interlopers who would disrupt the delicate work of the Heavenly Dragons by reshaping the earth to their twisted needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires75;So I shall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires75001;It is hard to see the will of the Celestial Dragons, but surely you must have pleased them by eradicating the legacy of the Imperial Scribe and in reconquering the Dragon Isles in their honor.\n They must be pleased with you, for Xen Huong has sent another great army, so that you might expand Cathay's colonial dreams of conquest even further West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires75001;And so it shall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60018;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Zan Long, the Ordainer, the one who determines the tasks and castes, has shared with you a fraction of his ancient knowledge, granting you preternatural eloquence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60018;I am honored by his gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60019;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Yein, the Heavenly Sibling of Conquest, has opened your mind to memories of ancient battles on the grounds and skies of the Fabled Cathay, granting you a deeper insight on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60019;I'll put this knowledge to good use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60020;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Zan Long, the Ordainer, has guided you to the gates of the Celestial Palace and showed you some fragments from the scrolls upon which the laws of the Heavens were written.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60020;I see all so clearly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60021;Your search inside the sickly reflections of the Dark Crystal has led you into somber and cold places. You've seen the great lair of the Sleeping One, Xao Saen, oldest of the Heavenly Dragons, and he has shared fragments of his dreams with you, showing you long-forgotten secrets and tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60021;A great gift to keep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60022;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. The unending spires of the Heavenly City unravel around you as you float beneath the shadow of Fa Xeng, the Firegiver and most beloved amongst the Cathayans. His mere sight is enough to unlock the potential of your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60022;So much knowledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60023;You've spent days gazing into the Dark Crystal and you've seen glimpses of the shining coils of the Dragon-Gods. Yet, it's in the night and a tick fog that you may see the divine eyes of Xen Huong, Judge of Life and Fate. In the reflection of the terrible eyes of the Dragon-Emperor you see what lies before you and know that you are blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60023;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires76;Confirmation has come that the former Imperial Scribe has reached the Heavenly City. The wretched renegate entered its sacred gates, never to leave them again. It is unknown what was the judgement bestowed upon him by Xen Huong, but you are certain this is the last you hear of Shdroi So'sou.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires76;After so many centuries, justice is served.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires76001;Sadly, the corrupted Jade had still enough power to charm his guards and slither away at the moment of your triumph. Shdroi So'sou has escaped justice once more and plots again for your destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires76001;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60024;In the dark reflections of the crystal you've found peace and clarity of mind. The glimpse you've catched of the slopes of the Heavens built by the Dragon Gods has placated the voices and restored your sanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60024;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires60025;The wicked taint of Chaos could not bear the poisonous light of the Dark Crystal. As you gazed into it, the corrupted flesh melted away, cleansing your body from he touch of the Warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires60025;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires77;You've broken the Law of Heavens, you no longer care about the edicts of the Dragon-Emperor. Thus, crawl in the darkness, for you shall nevermore set coil peacefully in the Celestial Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires77;Ssso be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires78;Oi, Bozz! Sumfhin'z wrong! Da zpiderz iz all mad at uz! Maybbe we'z goin' da wrong way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires78;We don't go here, not makez da Zpider God angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires78;Ya git! Da zpiderz bring luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires78001;The signs you sent were enough to scare the meddling greenskins away. They will not dare to linger near the Shadowlands for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires78001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires78002;The greenskins ignored your warnings and are still marching closer to the Shadowrealm. Only violence will push them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires78002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE23;As the ages pass, you feel closer and closer to your sire. You own eternity to your creator and wish to give eternal love in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE23;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire23001;After decades of existance, you've forged an undeniable bond with your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. Yours will be an eternal love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire23001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE24;As the ages pass, you feel closer and closer to your sire. You own eternity to your creator and wish to give eternal love in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE24;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVAMPIRE25;You can no longer restrain yourself: your feelings for your beloved have become too strong for you to be separated. You must be with your mate together forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAVAMPIRE25;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire25001;[From.GetFirstName]'s love for you has grown to the point [From.GetSheHe] can no longer be without you. Forsaking all reason, your lover swarms on you to embrace you forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire25001;*Allow [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
bugpeoplesex;Your lover will consume you;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBvampire25001;*Cast [From.GetHerHim] out*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire25002;You weep of joy as you consume [From.GetFirstName]. It is soon done, now you are one with [From.GetHerHim] forever, no longer will you feel alone and longing for [From.GetHerHis] embrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire25002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCvampire25003;[From.GetFirstName] has rejected your love. You were wrong: [From.GetSheHe] doesn't care for you and deserves nothing in return but your contempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAvampire25003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDR_universities.33;[From.GetFirstName] has excelled beyond your expectations: he has returned from the great university of Martek wielding the holy flames of Ormazd. Having a Scholar in your family will bring great prestige to your dynasty and help in the fight against the darkness in the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTADR_universities.33;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires79;The Mahtmasi swarmed inside you and the vermin devoured you from inside out for an entire, agonizing night and day. Finally, you rise again. Where first ran blood, now crawls vermin, all life has been sucked out of you and you are reborn as a new Mahtmasi vampire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires79;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires79001;You spent a night inside your victim, drinking their blood from the inside and leaving a new life behind you. Now, this kindred spirit has reborn as a Carrion Child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires79001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires80;The Mahtmasi swarmed inside you and the vermin devoured you from inside out for an entire, agonizing night and day. It was too much for your body to bear and you collapsed midway through the transformation. As you lay dying on the ground, you can hear the vampire weep over you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires80;Ghh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires80001;You spent a night inside your victim, drinking their blood from the inside and leaving a new life behind you, but, despite their efforts, their body was not ready to handle the Blood Kiss: when you reemerge the following night, your fledgling is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires80001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires81;No Big Bokor exists to link the world of the living with the Shadowrealm. The balance has been broken and the Shadowgate collapses on itself, cutting off the Mahtmasi from their ethereal domain. Never again will the bloodline of Maatmeses hold sway over the people of the Southlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires81;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsvampires81001;The elusive realm of the Shadowmen has been finally destroyed. The tendrils of the Shadowlands have stopped to clutch onto the lands of the Bayaji. Never again will the bloodline of Maatmeses hold sway over the people of the Southlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsvampires81001;The Shadowmen have stopped to answer your prayers and accept your offerings. No witch-doctor has felt their presence for days now, it seems as if they abandoned the Southlands entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires81001;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires81001;I will not abandon them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires81001;They have forsaken us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires82001;You've been convinced by your Bokors that you need some time to meditate and recover from your recent defeat. It is possible another Big Bokor will be more appropriate to fight the current enemies of the Bayaji.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires82001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83;You've located something close enough to [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to work the binding magic upon the fetish. Now it's only a question of acquiring the object;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83;My co-conspirators will provide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83;I'll make preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires.83;I know exactly what to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires.83;Too risky - I will bide my time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83001;You've located something close enough to your target to interest your mysterious employer. Now it's only a question of acquiring the object;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83001;*Ask the Plot head for funds*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83002;My co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], is asking for funds to provide you the item you need for the voodoo ritual against [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83002;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83002;Even [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] suffreing is not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83003;[From.GetTitledName] has sent me the necessary funds to acquire one of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s personal belongings...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83004;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to give you the money asked in return from stealing [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s personal item.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83004;I will pay for it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83004;Forget it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83005;After a long and tiring day, you're ready to welcome the embrace of a deep slumber. You leave your court and move to the safety of your chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83005;I'm so tired;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires.83005;What was that shadow!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83006;A thief, lurking in your very chambers! The burglar slips away before you can summon your guards, but you recognize who it is and who sent it. It's hard to spot at first, but later you realize one of your personal items has disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83006;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83007;A thief, lurking in your very chambers! The burglar slips away before you can summon your guards and there's no way of recognizing it. Strangely enough, there doesn't even seem to be anything missing in your rooms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83007;What was he doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83008;You catch the thief before he can slip away in the shadows again. Soon, the little scoundrel lays on the torture table, gasping the name of his employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83008;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].. I wonder what was [FromFrom.GetSheHe] trying to accomplish;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83009;You scare off the thief with your screams, but he slips away in the shadows before you can catch him. At the very least he will go back to his master empty-handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83009;What could he wanted?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83010;Your co-conspirator, [From.GetTitledName], has let you know that you will soon receive the item you crave for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83010;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83011;[From.GetTitledName] awaits for your success. [From.GetSheHe] certainly has some dark spell in store for [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83011;*Make the preparations*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83012;[From.GetTitledName] has let you know that the plot to acquire one of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s personal items is proceeding well.  You should soon receive the final ingredient for your curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83012;It's about time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83013;Success! [From.GetTitledName] may have discovered your involvement in the burglary, but now your doll is completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83013;Let the ritual begin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83014;Success!  [From.GetTitledName]'s fate is within your hands and [From.GetSheHe] doesn't even realize it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83014;Let the ritual begin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83015;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] caught the burglar and your complicity in the theft was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83015;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires.83016;Failure! [From.GetTitledName] discovered the thief, but was unable to uncover the conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires.83016;We will just have to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires84;You place the little ragdoll on your table and prepare all the other tools. It took some time, but you're finally ready to act upon [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires84;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires84002;You may perform a voodoo curse to afflict [From.GetFirstName] and those near to [From.GetHerHim]. What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires84002;*Curse [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] lands*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires84002;*Curse [From.GetHerHis] lands*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires84002;*Curse [From.GetHerHim]*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires84002;*Annull the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85;Something is wrong. For days now you've had trouble resting. It wouldn't have bothered you as much if you didn't receive news a similar discontent was growing amongst your subjects as well. The people are growing unhappy and susceptible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85;I will fight this evil curse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85;What is happening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85001;[From.GetFirstName] was more resourceful than you expected: [From.GetSheHe] fought off your curse and rid [From.GetHerHim]self of its dark influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85001;This was a waste of time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85002;A grim shadow has covered [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s land. Now it is time to tighten your hold and unleash the true potential of your curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85002;*Spread darkness and discontent*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85002;*Summon a plague of locusts*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85003;Whatever dark influence was trying to take hold in your land has been exorcised. You won't have to fear for your life and that of those around you for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85003;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85100;A shroud of darkness heavies upon all of your lands, weakening your will and the resolve of all your subjects. Crime and discontent are on the rise and people have started whispering there is a curse laid upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85100;How can this be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85101;[From.GetFirstName]'s subjects are starting to fear and hate their master as your curse flows through their lands, feeding off of their hopes and happiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85101;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85101;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85102;Children are born dead, corpses twitch restless in their graves, food spoils before time, water turns into poison Your realm is certainly cursed. An unescapable feeling of crushing defeat heavies upon your soul and that of your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85102;Will we ever be happy again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85103;[From.GetFirstName]'s lands are wrapped into a thick shroud of defeat and despair, weakening their will and soul. Their children are born dead, corpses twitch restless in their graves, food spoils before time and water turns into poison. Every night dark clouds cover the moons and stars, leaving the scared peasants hiding in their shacks, cold and terrified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85103;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85103;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85104; Every night dark clouds cover the moons and stars, leaving your scared peasants hiding in their shacks, cold and terrified. At every dawn new dead are found, killed by thiefs or rambling lunatics. The curse is spreading in the nearby lands as well, angering your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85104;We're doomed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85200;It started as nothing, a few missing tributes and unhappy peasants, but now the plague of locust has revealed itself in all it's terrible glory. The vermin has started to swarm over your capital, finding its way into any storage, devouring all of your reserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85200;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85201;The first swarms have reached [From.GetFirstName]'s capital. From there, they will spread into [From.GetHerHis] entire realm, if allowed to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85201;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85201;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85202;The plague of locusts has spread to all of your lands, growing deadlier every day. The insatiable creatures have started to attack your subjects as well, leaving half-eaten corpses on their wake. The few desperate people who attempt to eat the vermin itself for sustenance discovered it to be poisonous as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85202;What sort of curse is this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85203;As expected, the plague of locusts has spread to all of [From.GetFirstName]'s lands. Allowing it to grow still will further weaken [From.GetHerHis] realm and anger [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85203;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires85203;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires85204;The vermin is everywhere, swarming into every house, biting and carving its way into everything that is not made of stone and metal. If it's not stopped, it will reduce your entire realm into a barren wasteland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires85204;What *can* I do!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86;Something is wrong. There are news of discontent growing amongst your subjects. There is no discernable cause for the unrest within your land, it must be the work of some evil curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86;I will fight it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86;What is happening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86002;A grim shadow has covered [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s land. Now it is time to tighten your hold and unleash the true potential of your curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86002;*Spread darkness and discontent*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86002;*Spread a plague*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86100;A shroud of darkness heavies upon all of your lands, weakening your will and the resolve of all your subjects. Crime and discontent are on the rise and people have started whispering there is a curse laid upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCsvampires86102;Corpses twitch restless in their graves, food spoils before time, water turns into poison Your realm is certainly cursed. An unescapable feeling of crushing defeat heavies upon the souls of your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86102;Will we ever be happy again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86103;[From.GetFirstName]'s lands are wrapped into a thick shroud of defeat and despair, weakening their will and soul. Corpses twitch restless in their graves, food spoils before time and water turns into poison. Every night dark clouds cover the moons and stars, leaving the scared peasants hiding in their shacks, cold and terrified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86103;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86103;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86104; Every night dark clouds cover the moons and stars, leaving your scared peasants hiding in their shacks, cold and terrified. People refuse to work or flee in terror from your settlements, trying to find a more peaceful existance elsewhere. The curse is spreading in the nearby lands as well, angering your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86104;We're doomed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86200;An insidious disease has started to spread in your palace. You're a the first to cough blood, but soon news of other courtiers reach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86200;It's horrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86201;[From.GetFirstName] has been struck by your disease. Now it's only a question of allowing the sickness to spread around [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86201;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86201;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86202;The sickness has spread through many other courtiers and households within your capital. People have started to die in the street, their corpses laying in pools of their own blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86202;*Cough* *Cough*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86203;[From.GetFirstName]'s disease has spread to [From.GetHerHis] court and capital. If you continue to maintain the curse, it shall spread out further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86203;*Keep the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires86203;*End the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires86204;Fewer and fewer people can claim good health in your realm. As time passes, more are found out coughing blood. There is certainty the sickness is not natural and may never stop until all of you are dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires86204;*Cough* *Cough*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87;You wake soaked in sweat. It's hard to describe, but you feel as if being observed, as if someone was holding you, even though you are alone in your chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87;It's dark magic at work! I must dispell it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87;It's probably nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87002;You hold [From.GetFirstName]'s doll in one hand, picking one of your tools with the other and whispering the incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87002;*Pin the doll*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87002;*Carve the doll's eyes out*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires87002;*Squash the doll*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires87002;Something else;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87004;You hold [From.GetFirstName]'s doll in one hand, picking one of your tools with the other and whispering the incantation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87004;*Cut the doll's genitalia*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87004;*Boil the doll's head*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsvampires87004;*Bind the doll's heart*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDsvampires87004;Thinking again;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87100;You scream in pain as a deep and narrow wound suddenly appears in your flank, swiftly followed by a second one on your chest. There's nobody around you, nothing to defend yourself against, thus you can only lay in torment and endure the shadowy attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87100;Hnnngh..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87101;One after the other, you pin more rusty needles into the voodoo doll, feeling the pain reverberating from [From.GetFirstName] through the raggety fetish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87101;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87101;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87200;An sudden excruciating pain cuts through your eyes and into your head. You try to protect your face as blood spills from your now-empty eyesockets. You've been blinded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87200;Aaaargh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87201;You throw away the last eyebutton from the ragdoll, satisfied with your work, with the mental image of [From.GetFirstName] still screaming and bleeding lingering in your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87201;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87201;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87300;No matter how much you feed, you grow weaker every day, puking away whatever you manage to eat. Your body is becoming more and more fragile, consumed by hunger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87300;Ugh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87301;You tighten the tie around the ragdoll's belly, feeling the unsatiable hunger of Maatmeses passing down on your unwary victim and consuming [From.GetHerHis] body and soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87301;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87301;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87400;You awake in your bed, drenched in sweat, with your body shaking in pain. As you try to get up, you discover the sheets are soaked in your blood, pouring in from an open wound between your legs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87400;Aaaaaah!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87401;You give another cut between the tiny legs of the ragdoll and put the scissors away, satisfied with the result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87401;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87401;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87500;You can't think, it's as if you're head is about to explode. Thoughts mix together, your blood boils and everyone looks distant and threatening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87500;What was that?! Oh, right;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87501;You keep the head of the doll inside the cauldron for some time, allowing it to fry [From.GetFirstName]'s mind for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87501;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87501;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87600;It feels as if those closer to your are now plotting for your demise. Can you not trust anybody anymore? You loved them, but they all hate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87600;They deserve only my contempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires87601;Once the doll's name has been properly tied, you feel the love of [From.GetFirstName]'s wither and slowly die under the compulsion of the curse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires87601;*Continue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires87601;*Stop the curse*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires88;Crawling undead things from Beyond come at your call. You relay the silent orders and let them fly away in the night to recover what you require for your spell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires88;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires89;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has forsaken the wisdom of the Akghan and reverted to the barbaric worship of the Shadowmen in [From.GetHerHis] desperation. Will you join [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires89;Yes, the Shadowmen must be appeased!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires89;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91;You thought you would share eternity with your lover, but not that you would share your lover with others. This must stop, either it's yours only or nobody's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91;Give ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires91;I can share;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91001;[From.GetFirstName] is tired of sharing you with your other lovers. Either you pick [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHim] only to the end of times, or [From.GetSheHe] will leave forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91001;Of course I love you only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsvampires91001;There's the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91002;[From.GetFirstName] lied to you: [From.GetSheHe] never really loved, [From.GetSheHe] would rather spend [From.GetHerHis] days wrapped in the cold arms of other undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91002;I HATE you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91003;[From.GetFirstName] understood [From.GetHerHis] error and promised you to send all of [From.GetHerHis] other lovers away and be with you to the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91003;Finally alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsvampires91004;The vicious [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has managed to charm [FromFrom.GetHerHis] way into convincing your beloved [From.GetFirstName] to leave you for [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsvampires91004;I'll make [FromFrom.GetHerHim] regret it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

nightmare_mount;Nightmare Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nightmare_mount_desc;Vampires and Wights often ride into battle on these undead steeds. They are re-animated carcasses of mighty destriers, their bodies rotted and maggot-riddled. Nightmares are particularly favoured by the Blood Dragon Knights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
