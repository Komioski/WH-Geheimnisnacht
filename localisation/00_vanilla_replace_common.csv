#BM_NORTHERN_MERCANTILE_SOCIETY_DESC;In a bid to regain some of the trade lost from the secession of Marienburg, the Electors of Hochland, Ostland and Nordland have funded the foundation of a new merchant league in the Sea of Claws. Based in the towns of Neues Emskrank and Salkalten, Jens-Peter hopes to build a profitable enterprise in the northern Empire. With fierce opposition from the established powers in Marienburg and Erengrad, the survival of the Northern Mercantile Society is not guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Since 1359 IC, the Empire had been naught but a fading dream, with several claimants continuously disputing their right to rule, by pen and sword, and in the fateful Geheimnisnatch of 2010 IC a new threat arose from the most unexpected of places." \n-Grand Theogonist Volkmar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_VAMPIRE_DESC;The turn of the millennium was a time of great change and upheaval in what was left of the Empire. It was heralded in an ominous fashion when the city of Mordheim was destroyed by a warpstone meteor at the stroke of midnight. For over six centuries the Empire had been in a state of civil war, with each of claimants to the Imperial throne making war upon any who would deny their right to rule. This infighting would prove to have disastrous consequences, as heresy and corruption of all kinds festered and grew in the absence of any unified strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Era 1 (846 characters)
ERA_CHAR_INFO_80000;Independent from Stirland since the Night of the Restless Dead in 1681, Sylvania had long been ruled by the von Drak dynasty. This all changed in 1797 when Count Otto 'the Mad', now on his death bed, married his daughter Isabella to the mysterious Vlad von Carstein to keep his brother Leopold from the throne. Leopold von Drak saw his inheritance slipping away and protested the union, only to be hurled from the castle's window by Vlad. This was later known as the First Defenestration of Drakenhof. Vlad and Isabella ruled for many years in a fair, but often brutal fashion (as can be seen in the Second through Thirteenth Defenestrations of Drakenhof). As Sylvania was backwater in the Empire, no one questioned how each new Count of Sylvania looked so similar to the one before him. However, Sylvania will not stay a backwater for much longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_51000;During what was later known as the Time of Three Emperors, the line of elected Emperors continued to hold against the Emperors of Talabecland and the Wolf Emperors of Middenland. This tenuous authority ended in 1979 IC when the infant Grand Baroness Magritta van der Maacht of Westerland was elected with only the support of Elector Counts of Wissenland, Stirland, and Averland. The Grand Theogonist, seeing this for the farce that was, declared the office of Emperor vacant. Magritta naturally disputes this and is willing to enforce her claim through force of arms if need be. The fractured states in the Empire could provide the opportunity for 'Empress' Magritta to make this dream become a reality, or it could be her destruction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_84000;Following the death of the legendary Mandred 'Skavenslayer', the office of Emperor became a ceremonial title, traded among the Elector Counts for favours. This state of affairs ended in 1359 IC when the the Grand Count of Stirland was elected to serve as Emperor, much to the chagrin of Grand Duchess Ottilia of Talabecland. Supported by the cult of Taal and Rhya, Ottilia decided to press her own claim to the throne. Despite winning a decisive victory in the Battle of the Talabec in 1360 IC, Ottilia was ultimately unable take the throne for herself. Still, Talabeland's independence and Ottilia's claim to the throne have been preserved to this day. The current (self styled) Empress Ottilia, like her ancestor of the same name, seeks to unite the Empire under her rule. It remains to be seen if ancient Talabecland can survive the coming wars...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_88000;In the aftermath of the Grand Theogonist's dissolution of the Empire in 1980 IC, nobles across the Empire began to picture themselves sitting the Imperial throne. Greatest among these was Grand Prince Siegfried von Holzkrug of Reikland. Reikland has always considered itself the most important place in the Empire, as it was location where the the Unberogen tribe of Sigmar's blood had settled. Altdorf's strategic location on the Reik and the near-unconditional support of the Cult of Sigmar has always helped reinforce this claim, much to the chagrin of other Electors. Known elsewhere as the Reikland Pretender, Siegfried seeks the Imperial throne for himself and already has the support of Wissenland. Only time will tell if Siegfried's abilities are equal to his ambitions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_81000;Almost two centuries after the civil war over the Imperial throne began, the matter was still not settled. The situation worsened noticeably when the Ulrican Grand Duke Heinrich of Middenland lost the Imperial Election to the Sigmarite Grand Count of Wissenland. Believing himself robbed of his birthright he stormed off in a rage back to Middenheim. There, with the support of the Ar-Ulric, the Grand Duke issued a proclamation declaring himself Emperor, issuing coins and edicts to that effect, and declaring the Sigmarite faith false and heretical. This Ulrican line of so-called 'Wolf' Emperors has continued to this day with Mannfred Todbringer, but like his ancestors it may well be that his reach exceeds his grasp...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Era 2
ERA_CHAR_INFO_31003;The wasteland warlord known as Auntina has gathered power for many years in the unforgiving realms of the north. Now she is ready to make a push for control of the brutal arena of champions in Zanbaijin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_42039;Cast out at a young age for possessing the gift of magic, Azalaïs survived in the wilderness, searching for any who would help her master her gift. She found her allies in the dark, forgotten places inhabited by the twisted, the dispossessed, and the outcast who exist in spite of those who would burn them out. It was not long before she grew in influence enough to lead an army of outlaws, mutants and monsters on her old home and kill all who had once looked down on her. Now the infinite possibilities of Tzeentch are open to her, and none shall stand in her way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_34008;Tat-Ugek has done well for himself in the harsh and twisted landscape of the Chaos Wastes, but why fall into indolence? The wild tribes of the Wastes needs to be subjugated and taught the true extent of Nurgle's love, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_35020;Immortal Jozan has ruled the dreaded Zanbaijin - the Arena of Champions - for countless years now, Or has he? Time flows differently in the Chaos Wastes. Jozan rules all the nearby Kurgan tribes with a bloody iron fist, promising them glory, a special place in Khorne's Domain and a chance to - by his hand - rise from the ashes of this world, if they follow him to bloodied victory and death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_25022;Valka Grov has risen to the leadership of the Varg Norscans, propelled by a viciousness and cunning that has proven her a worthy vessel of the gods. Bearing the mark of mutation, she has been blessed by Slaanesh with the ability and ambition to conquer and rule like no other mortal. From the north rides the Serpent Queen, and who would deny her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Era 3
ERA_CHAR_INFO_95001;Considered an eccentric leader, and expected to be easily manipulated by his advisors, Bel-Hathor was crowned Phoenix King of Ulthuan in 1503. As a wizard prince of Saphery, he was trained to be a skilled warrior and an able diplomat. He would also prove to be a strong ruler, famed for his resolve and wisdom. Despite urgings from his court, Bel-Hathor knew an invasion of Naggaroth would cripple Ulthuan, as well as gamble the extinction of the Elven race, even if the invasion proved successful. Instead, he constructed a system of magical wards around Ulthuan to mislead and confuse potential invaders with illusions. When lone human traders still managed to find their way to Lothern, Bel-Hathor issued a proclamation barring all non-elves from Ulthuan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_90000;Prince of the northern province of Nagarythe, considered to be the next Phoenix King, but the Elven court felt he was not suited to rule. Malekith was instead appointed Commander of the High Elf army, and he seemed to take the turn of events well and proved to be a brilliant general. Many decades passed and Malekith worked himself into a position of power second only to the Phoenix King, and in -2751 IC he accused the King of being a member of the forbidden Cult of Pleasure. With the king's 'suicide', Malekith demanded that the crown pass to him. Malekith confidently marched into the sacred flame of the god Asuryan to prove himself as Phoenix King, yet the flame refused to suffer his presence and terribly scarred his body. After a long and bloody civil war, Malekith and his followers retreated into exile vowing to one day return and retake Ulthuan...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_60001;Immortal, eternal ruler of Athel Loren, avatar of the goddess Isha and parter to Orion, avatar of Kurnous. She has ruled the forest realm for over three thousand years, facing threats ranging from Chaos incursions to the migrations of Greenskins. Athel Loren has endured it all, but how much longer can it last?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_53009;High King Alrik Deathdealer is the spiritual leader of the Dwarfs as direct descendant of Grungni, ancestor god of mining and smiths, and also King of Karaz-a-Karak - the Everpeak - the largest and most powerful Dwarf stronghold. Concerned by the rise of Vlad von Carstein, he plans to send Dwarf aid against him to whichever Human claimant comes on top of the Imperial Civil War. Most of his subjects though disgree with this, arguing that the protection of the southern Dwarf holds against the Greenskin menace is of paramount importance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_54010;Astragoth is the oldest living Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer-Prophet, and thus, their leader, as the title of High Priest of Hashut traditionally falls to the oldest among them. He is one of the most potent sorcerers to walk the Plain of Zharr in a thousand years. Most of the Dawi Zharr consider Astragoth quite mad, but while he lives he is still the High Priest of Hashut and they must accept him. Directing the wicked industry of Zharr-Naggrund from atop the Temple of Hashut, he has set his sights on unifying the realm of Ankor-Naggrund...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#Era 4
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15025;In life, Neferata was Queen of the city of Lahmia. After Nagash's first defeat, she procured the Nine Books of Nagash for herself and captured Arkhan the Black, Nagash's most favoured servant. Together they replicated the 'Elixir of Life', originally created by Nagash and thought to prevent death. When her husband poisoned the Elixir in an attempt to stop her plot to take over Lahmia, it brought unforeseen consequences. Neferata died after drinking the poisoned Elixir... and rose again as first of the vampires, immortal creatures who feed on the essence of the living. She shared her "gift" among her closest aristocrats, who went onto found their own vampiric bloodlines. Eventually driven out of Lahmia, she now rules the secretive Lahmian Sisterhood from the ruined hold of Silver Pinnacle, plotting to rule once again as Queen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15000;A nobleman of Lahmia and brother to Queen Neferata, Ushoran was amongst the first to be gifted Neferata's diluted Elixir of Life. Eventually, when Neferata and her court were driven from Lahmia, Ushoran travelled to what is now known as the Badlands and unified the humans there under his rule, founding the empire of Strygos. Ruling from Mourkain as a wise, immortal ruler, he and his vampiric followers only fed on the realm's criminals and lowlifes. This was ended by a gigantic Greenskin WAAAGH! which destroyed Mourkain and Strygos, he and his followers were forced to flee. Hated by the other vampire bloodlines and unable to settle, his bloodline were able to feed only on the dead, which eventually transformed them into the bestial Strigoi. Ushoran now roams the world alongside the Strigany nomads, yearning to reclaim their homeland...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11010;In ancient times, Settra was the first King of Khemri, and by far the most powerful and renowned. He united all the city-states of Nehekhara under his ruthless rule in a great campaign of conquest. As he grew old, he founded the Mortuary Cult, ordering his Liche Priests to find a way to defeat death itself. Settra died with the promise to be reborn as a god once his servants found the proper spell, but he was awoken along with all of his successors as an undead abomination by the usurper Nagash. Retaking his rightful seat in Khemri, he wages war against the other Tomb Kings that awoke into undeath, so that he might rule once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11004;Arkhan the Black, the Liche King, was the first and most loyal of Nagash's followers and his first lieutenant. When Nagash usurped the throne of Nehekhara from his brother, Arkhan was named Grand Vizier by him. He died in a suicidal mission against the Priest King coalition, thus giving Nagash the opportunity to escape. As a reward, he was raised as a Liche by his master, and while we has defeated by King Alcadizzar's armies and later once more by Sigmar, he rose again. Now, he has established himself once again in Nehekhara, in his fortress of old, the Black Tower. From here, he plans to sow terror once more, as the Liche King of Kyrene...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_11017;Khalida, the beloved of Asaph and warrior-queen of Lybaras. She was a respected leader, known across all Nehekhara as a just and honourable ruler. Cousin to the infamous Neferata, Khalida was the first to discover her dark secret. Falsely accused of treason by Neferata during a great banquet, Khalida challenged her to a duel. After a long and arduous fight, she was struck down by the empowered Neferata and forced to drink her blood in order to be turned into a vampire herself. Pleading to the goddess Asaph to save her, Khalida was cleansed of the vampiric taint but also drained of her remaining life. Entombed in a sacred reliquary, she awakened along the rest of Nehekhara's past rulers due to Nagash's spell. Once more reigning as the Warrior-Queen of Lybaras, she has set herself the goal of eradicating all vampires...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
#Era 5
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2065;"Goblins live on the cast-offs of other races and frequently thrive in the shadows of their larger green skinned cousins, the Orcs. They are, in general, a miserable treacherous race of petty thieves and vicious cutthroats. There is no depth of casual cruelty or random violence to which a Goblin will not sink, if it senses that it has the power to do so. Goblins can be found just about everywhere, though they tend to favour the mountains. During my travels through the Dwarf realms, I heard the particular story of a Night Goblin tribe inhabiting the once glorious hold of Karak Eight Peaks..."\n- Professor Odric von Wurtbad, University of Altdorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_8001;"Many Beastmen are born to apparently ordinary Humans in the Empire, but in fact the Beastmen of the wild breed virulently too. Around the edges of the civilised world, the taint of Chaos is strong. Here whole new Beastmen armies are born, live, and often die fighting against each other before they ever pose a threat to the stability of civilization, but those who survive always emerge eventually, stronger than ever before. In the vast, untamed land of Norsca, these beasts are much more common and vicious. Here's the 'Tale of the Foulspawn', a gruesome account of one of the bloodiest beastlords to ever prowl the northern lands, translated from the sagas of the Aesling tribe..."\n- Professor Odric von Wurtbad, University of Altdorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10011;"Though I have not set foot myself on the poisonous jungles that cover most of the continent of Lustria, I've observed the dissection of a specimen of its scaly inhabitants, one of the smaller, smooth-skinned creatures. I also had the occasion of interviewing its slayer, an Estalian mercenary by the name of Vicente de Carranza. They are part of a larger species, under a rigid caste system. Apparently the lesser specimens are the administrators and artisans, while their larger kind are the warriors. There is supposedly a caste of priests, vastly different from the rest, that leads the whole race, but the mercenary hadn't seen any of them. He then told me about the golden city of Itza, one of their greatest settlements..."\n- Professor Odric von Wurtbad, University of Altdorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_506;"Ogres are big, ugly, brutish monsters that excel at two things: eating and fighting. An Ogre is easily recognized by this massive frame and boulder-like gut, and their grayish, flabby skin conceals tough muscle and alarming endurance. Amongst most folk, this combined with their bristle-like hair and poor personal hygiene is enough reason to shun these crude beasts. Now, no one who has ever smelt an Ogre will believe this, but they are an exceedingly proud race. I had the dubious pleasure of meeting one, and after what seemed an endless meal, proceeded to tell me about the exploits of Tyrant Tharteg of the Gutbreaker tribe, most ponderous Sovereign of Highgrasp"\n- Professor Odric von Wurtbad, University of Altdorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2029;"Orcs are an all-too-familiar sight to many ordinary folk throughout much of the Old World, especially to the south where Orc tribes raid out of the Badlands on a regular basis. Orc culture is based on the idea that it is the right and indeed duty of the strong to oppressively rule the weak. Larger, stronger Orcs are accorded higher status, and indeed an Orc can potentially keep growing throughout his life. All Orcs, even the cleverest, resemble nothing so much as squabbling toddlers that have been magically granted enormous size, horrendous strength, and a variety of barbaric weapons. While staying at the Border Princedom of Akendorf, I was told the tale of the Orc fortress of Iron Rock"\n- Professor Odric von Wurtbad, University of Altdorf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
#ERA_CHAR_INFO_1550000;Tzarina Tetyana may be undisputed ruler of a strong and independent people, but her position is hardly enviable. Her allies are at best unreliable and prone to barbarism, and her enemies are far worse. The Gospodar tribe decided to settle on the unforgiving plains of Kislev, carved from the northern marches of the Empire, but the land is still open to invasion. The Ungol and Roppsman tribes may have been humbled by her ancestors, but they remain strong and independent. The Norscan savages to the north are an ever-present threat, and the Kurgan have begun to migrate south as well, bringing their Dark Gods with them. To the south, the squabbling Imperial claimants continue their bloodshed for no gain, but the newest contender, Vlad, might not prove content with just the Empire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# DYNASTY DESCRIPTIONS
#
DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Holswig-Schliestein. Originally lords of Ubersreik, the family quietly built its wealth and prestige as wars raged all around. The family catapulted to fame when the childless Magnus the Pious chose to pass the realm of Reikland to his good friend Wilhelm, rather than to a distant relative. The family held this title for many years until the latest Prince of Reikland, Wilhelm III won the Imperial throne after the debacle of Dieter IV's abdication. Since then they have yet to relinquish the position, maintaining an unbroken series of generally popular Emperors. The latest in the family being Karl-Franz, who has had to face the worst challenges the Empire has ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Carstein. The von Carsteins originated with Vlad von Carstein, a powerful Vampire who in 1797 married Isabella von Drak, daughter of the Graf of Sylvania. With subterfuge, brutality and sorcery he took control of the province, eliminated resistance and recruited promising nobles into his Vampiric bloodline. His influence grew until he attempted to take over the fractured Empire in 2010, which resulted in his death in 2051 during the siege of Altdorf. Without his dominant leadership, his extensive 'family' of Vampires, cultists and necromancers fragmented into competing claimants, allowing them to be defeated piecemeal by the armies of the Empire. Despite the infighting and setbacks, the von Carstein bloodline survived and has continued to grow in influence, most notably under the control of Mannfred von Carstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN3_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Bildhofen. This house is very old and widespread, with landed estates found throughout the Empire, and several Electors hailing from their dynasty. The most famous of all is Magnus the Pious, formerly a minor noble of Nuln, who united the Empire through his bravery and zealous devotion to Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN4_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Untermensch. Despite the unfortunate name, the Untermensch family held a significant amount of influence on the history of the Empire. Most infamous of all is the first Ottilia, Elector of Talabecland, who rebelled against the Imperial election of 1359 and triggered the start of what would become the Age of Three Emperors. The Untermensch dynasty held onto the province of Talabecland and maintained their claim for the Imperial throne right until the ascension of Magnus the Pious in 2304. Despite their longevity and persistence, they never extended outside of Talabecland, and are mostly remembered for causing the fragmentation of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN5_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Bokha of Kislev. Directly descended from Khan-Queen Miska of the Gospodars, the Bokhas have withstood some of the fiercest Chaos incursions the world has seen, culminating in the invasion of Archaon the Everchosen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN6_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House van der Maacht. Their influence in Marienburg and Westerland stretches back into the hazy past, but it is believed they are distantly related to the various Nordlander ruling houses. The power of Marienburg under the van der Maachts grew as the Imperial system weakened during the Age of Three Emperors, as they took advantage of the general confusion and corruption to strengthen their own position. Nominally a subject territory of Nordland, the political and economic power of the city-state grew to the extent that in 1979 the infant Countess Magritta was elected Empress. The obvious fraud and bribery of the decision dissolved whatever integrity the Empire still had, and by 1980 the Empire had completely broken apart into constituent provinces and imperial claimants. The van der Maachts continued to make their claim for the Imperial throne, but were unable to make much headway due to the destruction caused by the Vampire Wars. In 2302, the last surviving member, Paulus van der Maacht, marched with Magnus the Pious to fight the forces of Chaos in Kislev. His death in battle resulted in the city being thrown into confusion over the succession, which Magnus solved in 2305 by giving control of the city to a board of merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN7_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Todbringer. Sometimes known instead as Wï¿½terich, they have held Middenland and Middenheim for many centuries, building a reputation for fierce and proud servants of Ulric. They are especially adept (or obsessed) at hunting down the Beastmen that plague their realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN8_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Holzkrug. The von Holzkrugs held the throne of Reikland for centuries during the Age of Three Emperors, and even held the Imperial throne at one point. With the support of the Grand Theogonist, they rebelled against the election of Magritta van der Maacht and attempted to press their own claim for the throne, resulting in the total fragmentation of the already ailing Empire. The rulers of Reikland gained some fame for their exploits in the Vampire Wars, but the distrust and enmity of their neighbours prevented them from reuniting the Empire. The family came to an end in 2302 when the last heir, Lorenz, travelled with Magnus the Pious to Kislev to fight in the Great War Against Chaos. His death caused no small turmoil in the succession, which resulted in the Grand Theogonist ceding control of the realm to Magnus in recognition of his services to Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN9_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Alptraum. The Alptraums ruled Averland for many generations, culminating in the occasionally brutal rule of Ludmilla von Alptraum. This came undone when the brilliant general Marius Leitdorf married Helena von Alptraum, sister to the heiress Marlene. With the backing of the state army and his marriage providing a veneer of legitimacy, Marius Leitdorf was able to push his claim on Averland, ending the reign of the von Alptraum family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN10_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Toppenheimer. Though not Electors, the Toppenheimers expanded through Wissenland and Solland, securing an excellent power base despite the best efforts of their peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN11_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Gausser. The Gausser family ruled Nordland for many years, and insisted that by bloodline they had the right to the errant realm of Marienburg. However, they were never able to enforce this claim, which if successful would have launched them to untold riches and prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN12_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Krystallbach. After the defeat of Mannfred von Carstein in 2145, a moment of ill-conceived ambition led Graf Martin von Krystallbach to declare that Sylvania was a component province of Stirland, to the mild concern of his peers. Although this did effectively double the size of his realm, Sylvania proved to be nigh-impossible to govern and remained a regional menace for centuries to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN13_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Drak. The von Draks of Sylvania were legendary in their ill-governance. Under their rule Sylvania was overrun by monsters and petty nobles abused their vassals with impunity. Their reign of ambivalent terror was only ended by the arrival of Vlad von Carstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN14_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Stoutheart. In the 26th century, Hisme Stoutheart achieved a record ten consecutive three-year terms as Elder of the Mootland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN15_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Nikse. The Nikse family were a minor noble family in Nordland, and are only known from their occasional marriages into the Todbringer dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
