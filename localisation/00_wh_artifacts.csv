hawks_talon;Hawk's Talon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hawks_talon_desc;Crafted from a single smooth span of rare wythelwood, Hawk's Talon is the pinnacle of the huntsman's craft. Of all the Elves, only Orion possesses the incredible strength to draw this weapon. This is as it should be, for as the forest's foremost hunter only he has the skill to wield Hawk's Talon to its fullest effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spear_of_kurnous;Spear of Kurnous;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spear_of_kurnous_desc;This spear is a living weapon. It was crafted long ago from the bole of the glorious birch tree that grew in Isha's heavenly garden, and bound with enchantments to nurture and renew its bearer. The Spear of Kurnous is irrevocably bound to its a foe, which he does often. The King in the Woods holds that a true hunter can bring down any prey with a spear as easily as a bow, and ever seeks to prove the merit of his words. Of course, the Spear of Kurnous' colossal size gives him a substantial advantage over other preyseekers — when driven by his peerless might, it can disembowel a deepwood auroch as easily as it can a man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cloak_of_isha;Cloak of Isha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cloak_of_isha_desc;This sacred garment is woven anew each spring by the Mage Queen Ariel herself. It is the only protection Orion wears in battle, and the only one that he needs. It is through the Cloak of Isha that Ariel grants her beloved a portion of her own strength, ensuring that the wounds he suffers are fleeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
horn_of_wild_hunt;Horn of the Wild Hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
horn_of_wild_hunt_desc;This horn is one of the oldest artifacts in all of Athel Loren. Legend tells it was a gift from Kurnous to his mortal children at the dawn of creation, a token of his favour that placed them above the myriad brutish beasts of the world. Now the Horn of the Wild Hunt has returned to its rightful master. In Orion's hands it is more than merely a symbol of a god's favour; it is the vessel of the Hunter God's savagery and determination, and imbues a portion of Kurnous' wildness in all who hear its blare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# ARIEL
#
wand_of_wych_elm;Wand of Wych Elm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wand_of_wych_elm_desc;This is a long, twisted and gnarled staff cut from the rare and magical Wych Elm tree. This tree draws magical power out of the ground as it grows and stores it in its wood. Any wand cut from such a tree may have centuries of stored magical power locked within it. The only way to tap the power locked in the wood is to cut a wand from the tree and inscribe a spell on it. The spell can then be cast using the power of the wand instead of the Winds of Magic. Only a demi-god or a wizard of exceptional skill can unlock and use such power. When Ariel takes on the divine aspect of the goddess Isha she gains the ability to use the power stored in the Wych Elm. The wand is never drained of power during the battle - indeed, it will not be drained for perhaps a thousand years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
acorn_of_the_ages;Acorns of the Oak of Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
acorn_of_the_ages_desc;These are shed by the tree each autumn and collected by Ariel because of their magical properties. When the acorns are scattered on the ground they instantly sprout into oak saplings which grow at a phenomenal pace to become trees in a moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dart_of_doom;Dart of Doom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dart_of_doom_desc;This dart was carved from a twig broken from the Tree of Woe. The tip of the dart is a thorn and the shaft is engraved with magical spiral designs. When hit, its victims see their energy drained away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berry_wine;Berry Wine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
berry_wine_desc;This is a magical and intoxicating brew made from the berries of magical trees. It is so potent that more than enough can be held in an acorn cup. Ariel uses it to invigorate herself or any injured allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heartstone_of_athel_loren;Heartstone of Athel Loren;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heartstone_of_athel_loren_desc;A physical representation of the many ties that bind Ariel to the forest of Athel Loren, this gemstone protects her from the effects of hostile magics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THALANDOR DOOMSTAR
#
magic_war_paint;Magic War Paint;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
magic_war_paint_desc;Thalandor paints himself with magical designs before going into battle. These can magically deflect blows from weapons and missiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talisman_of_qwarr;Talisman of Qwarr;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talisman_of_qwarr_desc;Qwarr was the mightiest of all the Great Eagles who ever lived and an ancestor of Gwandor himself. It was Qwarr who slew the ravenous dragon Grathgol when he came to steal eggs from his eyrie. Although the dragon plummeted to his doom, torn by Qwarr's talons, Qwarr himself also perished in the fight. Elves saw this terrible conflict in the air and preserved the mighty talons and beak of Qwarr as a powerful talisman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spear_of_daith;Spear of Daith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spear_of_daith_desc;This spear was made by Daith, legendary master craftsman of Loren. He carved upon its shaft mystical spirals which give the weapon a will of its own. Upon the hardened copper spearhead are engraved eyes that allow the spear to see the blows of the enemy and intercept them with its unbreakable hardwood shaft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# SCEOLAN
#
buckler_of_bronze;The Buckler of Bronze;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buckler_of_bronze_desc;Sceolan carries a buckler instead of an ordinary shield. This is a small shield with a spiked bronze boss and many bronze studs arranged in an arcane pattern. Not only does this buckler parry the blows of the enemy, but it can be used to strike back at any opponent who is parried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bow_of_loren;The Bow of Loren;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bow_of_loren_desc;The Bow of Loren is strung with the hair of Elf maids and enchanted with potent charms for increased power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# Sisters of Twilight
#
talon_dawn_naestra;Talon of Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talon_dawn_naestra_desc;Naestra's bow fires no mortal shot, but bolts of blessed light that melt through armor to sear the flesh beneath. It is said that the souls reaped by this weapon yield their energies to undo the harms they have wrought against the wielder’s allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talon_dusk_arahan;Talon of Dusk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talon_dusk_arahan_desc;The arrows of Arahan’s bow are crafted from the spirit husks of the Wildwood’s bitterest Dryads. Once loosed, they splinter into scores of poisonous thorns that seek the flesh of Athel Loren’s enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# IMRIK
#
star_lance;Star Lance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
star_lance_desc;The tip of this weapon is forged from the heart of a fallen star. With a blade of such keenness no armor can protect Imrik's foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armour_of_caledor;armor of Caledor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
armour_of_caledor_desc;For well over four thousand years the masters of the house of Caledor have worn this armor in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dragonhorn;Dragonhorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dragonhorn_desc;This war horn is made from the horn of an ancient dragon, gifted to Imrik's distant ancestors in elder days. The dying fire drake summoned all his remaining power to enchant his remaining unbroken horn as he lay bleeding in the aftermath of the Battle of the Glade of Tears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
minaithnir;Minaithnir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
minaithnir_desc;Imrik rides the majestic dragon Minaithnir. They have a mutual bond between them – the last of the true Dragon Princes, and one of the last dragons. Minaithnir is fanatically loyal to his master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# FINUBAR
#
starmetal_scimitar;Starmetal Scimitar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
starmetal_scimitar_desc;The Eleventh Phoenix King wields a sword of starmetal, its blade curved in the manner of Southland warriors and golden like the last arc of sunset. The blade had been a gift from one of the coastal potentates of Ind, a land of exotic spices and strange rituals. Finubar had saved the life of the king's daughter, and had received this wondrous blade in return. No smith trained in the Anvil of Vaul could unlock the mysteries of its creation, but the power of the magic worked into its blade was beyond question. When Finubar speaks the word of power, molten light erupts from the golden blade. During a battle against a hydra, he stabbed the blade into one of its mouths, activating his sword's magic to fill the monster's skull, golden fire streaming from its eyes before its head exploded in a welter of boiling blood and bone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# AENARION
#
sunfang_aenarion;Sunfang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sunfang_aenarion_desc;This ancient sword, forged to slay Daemons in the earliest days of Aenarion's rule, burns with the captured fire of the sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dragon_armour_aenarion;Dragon Armor of Aenarion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dragon_armour_aenarion_desc;This mighty armor was forged on Vaul's Anvil long ago to protect Aenarion. Upon his death, the armor was thought lost for thousands of years until it was recovered by Tethlis the Slayer. Repaired by Arathion, it is among the most powerful protective artifacts ever made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# TECLIS
#
sword_of_teclis;Sword of Teclis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sword_of_teclis_desc;This sword was forged by Teclis, a powerful weapon to protect himself as he began the perilous quest to rescue his brother Tyrion and the Everqueen. It is charged with crackling energy that rends apart those struck by its shining blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
moon_staff_of_lileath_teclis;Moon Staff of Lileath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
moon_staff_of_lileath_teclis_desc;The Moon Staff is imbued with the immortal power of the goddess Lileath, eternally youthful daughter of Isha, which flows through Teclis and invigorates his feeble frame. In times of great need, Teclis can call upon the full power of the staff. Doing so allows him to unleash a fearsome barrage of magical power, or else dissipate dangerous sorcerers energies before they spiral out of control, but also leaves Teclis himself badly weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
scroll_of_hoeth_teclis;Scroll of Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
scroll_of_hoeth_teclis_desc;Though seemingly fragile, this well-worn heirloom has seen a thousand battles and will see many more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
war_crown_of_saphery;War Crown of Saphery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
war_crown_of_saphery_desc;The War Crown is an ancient symbol of the magical realms of Saphery, seldom seen outside the walls of the White Tower except in times of peril. It was gifted to Teclis by the former High Loremaster on the eve of the young mage's departure on his quest for his brother, Tyrion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# ELTHARION
#
fangsword_of_eltharion;Fangsword of Eltharion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fangsword_of_eltharion_desc;This rune-encrusted longsword has been passed down through Eltharion's family for generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
helm_of_yvresse_eltharion;Helm of Yvresse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
helm_of_yvresse_eltharion_desc;The Helm of Yvresse is the ceremonial crown of the Warden of that proud city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talisman_of_hoeth_eltharion;Talisman of Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
talisman_of_hoeth_eltharion_desc;This finely wrought medallion allows its wearers a measure of the original Warden's magical knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eltharions_bow;Eltharion's Bow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eltharions_bow_desc;This bow is enchanted with elf magic that makes it much more accurate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stormwing_griffon_mount_eltharion;Stormwing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stormwing_griffon_mount_eltharion_desc;Together with Stormwing, Eltharion cuts through Ulthuan's foes like a wind of blades as the mighty Griffon rakes and claws with savagery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# ALITH ANAR
#
midnight_stone_alith;Stone of Midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
midnight_stone_alith_desc;This jewel was originally gifted to Morathi by Aenarion, and cloaks the wearer in shadow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shadow_crown_alith;Shadow Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shadow_crown_alith_desc;The Shadow Crown is the symbol of the rightful rulers of Nagarythe, a simple silver circlet set with a single diamond. By speaking the name of his kingdom, and defiantly claiming his rulership, Alith Anar can freeze time for a blink of an eye, giving himself a brief instant to slip away from harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
moonbow_alith;Moonbow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
moonbow_alith_desc;An exquisite weapon forged from a pale metal that glitters in the moonlight, the Moonbow was handed to Alith Anar by the goddess Lileath herself. The merest whisper of its arrows strikes fear into the hearts of the treacherous Naggarothi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# EVERQUEEN
#
shieldstone_of_isha_everqueen;Shieldstone of Isha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shieldstone_of_isha_everqueen_desc;The Shieldstone is as old as Ulthuan itself and pulses with inner energies. Only the Everqueen can release the power it contains to ward away harm from the pure-hearted, deflecting mortal blows and dashing arrows to the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
star_of_avelorn_everqueen;Star of Avelorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
star_of_avelorn_everqueen_desc;About her noble brow the Everqueen wears a diadem of ithilmar in which is set a single radiant gem, given by Aenarion in trust to Astarielle. This is no ordinary gem, but is said to be a star taken from the heavens by Isha and bound within a magic crystal, and holds the power to heal mortal wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stave_of_avelorn_everqueen;Stave of Avelorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
stave_of_avelorn_everqueen_desc;The Stave of Avelorn is the symbol of Alarielle’s míe over the land of Avelorn. It is an ancient heirloom which is passed from one Everqueen to the next, as it has been since before the time of the Phoenix Kings, and enables Alarielle to gather the magic that flows through that land and direct it as she wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heart_of_avelorn_everqueen;Heart of Avelorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
heart_of_avelorn_everqueen_desc;This bloody-red ruby was a gift from Everqueen Alarielle to Tyrion, and protects the bearer from death itself. It is said that if Tyrion were to fall, the Heart of Avelorn would break and restore him to life. Such renewal would not be without price, however. Should the Heart of Avelorn shatter, then whatever bond lies between Alarielle and Tyrion would also be sundered, never to be healed in all the ages of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
horn_of_isha_everqueen;Horn of Isha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
horn_of_isha_everqueen_desc;The Horn of Isha is fashioned from a single pearl-white seashell. Its creation remains a mystery to all the scholars and mages of Ulthuan, but it is known that the Horn has existed for as long as there have been Everqueens. When it is winded, the call of this beautiful instrument can split the veil between the mortal and immortal realms, rousing the mother goddess to grant a blessing upon her favoured children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
banner_of_avelorn_everqueen;Banner of Avelorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
banner_of_avelorn_everqueen_desc;Woven from living leaves and the hair of the Everqueen's Handmaidens, the Banner of Avelorn is an artefact of unsurpassed purity. It is crafted anew when an Everqueen ascends to the throne, and will one day serve as her funeral shroud. Whilst the Everqueen lives, the banner is a beacon of light and life. Should she perish, the magic imbued in it fades from the mortal world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# KORHIL
#
chayal_korhil;Chayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chayal_korhil_desc;The Captain of the White Lions has carried this keen-edged and finely balanced axe since the regiment's founding. Korhil is but the most recent of a long and honored line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelt_of_charandis_korhil;Pelt of Charandis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelt_of_charandis_korhil_desc;In return for Korhil's loyal service, Finubar directed that the pelt of the Great Lion of Chrace be fashioned into a magnificent, enchanted cloak.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# CARADRYAN
#
the_phoenix_blade_caradryan;The Phoenix Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_phoenix_blade_caradryan_desc;This ancient, flame-wreathed blade was enchanted for Kor-Baelon, the first Captain of the Phoenix Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashtari_frostheart_phoenix_mount_caradryan;Ashtari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ashtari_frostheart_phoenix_mount_caradryan_desc;Ashtari is the oldest and wisest of the Phoenixes of the Flamespyre. His bond with Caradryan goes back to centuries, to Caradryan's earliest years of service. At the battle of Finuval Plain, Ashtari picked an unequal fight with the Black Dragon Korzarandar, and it was only Caradryan's intervention that rescued the Phoenix from a grisly fate. Since those days, both Ashtari's flames and impetuousness have faded to naught, but his loyalty to Caradryan burns as brightly as ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# WIDOWMAKER
#
sword_of_khaine;The Sword of Khaine, Widowmaker;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sword_of_khaine_desc;The greatest weapon ever made by Vaul, it known by many names: Godslayer, Widowmaker, Doom of Worlds, Spear of Vengeance, Deathshard, Icefang, and Heavenblight. By many names it is called, by mortals, daemons and gods, but only one name alone it truly holds: Sword of Khaine, the Lord of Murder. This blade always drips with the blood of Eldanesh, the Elf who wielded it when he nearly defeated Khaine in battle. The weapon is the physical manifestation in the mortal realm of murder and violence, corrupting those who wield it and even those who are only near it. The malign forces emanating from the Widowmaker change personalities, replacing empathy with callousness, reason with hatred, and mercy with ruthlessness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# PHOENIX CROWNS
#
phoenix_crown_new;The Phoenix Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
phoenix_crown_new_desc;The original crown was captured by the Dawi after Caledor II was slain in battle against them. After his own rise to the Phoenix Throne, Caradryel soon determined that a replacement crown should be commissioned. The task of forging fell to the priests of Vaul, who undertook the work with all the diligence for which their order was famous and, after a century's labour, the new crown was completed. Mindful of Caledor's impetuousness, Caradryel's first decree whilst wearing the new Phoenix Crown was that this new symbol of Elven kingship would never enter the fires of battle. Furthermore, he announced that the crown would henceforth have a guard of one hundred White Lions of Chrace to watch over it at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
# GENERIC ASUR
#
asur_artifact_dragon_armour;Dragon armor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_dragon_armour_desc;Forged in the heart of a volcano, this fine armor is enchanted to ward off the blows of the enemy and is all but impervious to Dragon fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_bow_avelorn;Bow of Avelorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_bow_avelorn_desc;Warriors of Avelorn use these enchanted bows to slay their foes with volleys of flaming arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_lion_cloak;White Lion Cloak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_lion_cloak_desc;The fur of a slain war lion is worn both as a sign of status and for protection from enemy arrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_leaping_gold_blade;The Blade of Leaping Gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_leaping_gold_blade_desc;With this sword, Alcandor of Cothique singlehadndedly held the gates of Tor Estara for seven days. Mentheus, right hand of Morvael the Impetuous, wielded it until his death upon the walls of Anlec, having spilled more Dark Elf blood than any other since the time of Tethlis the Slayer. An ordinary blade would be dulled by such a roster of endless war, but this sword has never lost its edge. To the valiant, it lends supernatural speed and vigour but to the craven and corrupt, it brings only swift death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_reaver_bow;The Reaver Bow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_reaver_bow_desc;Imollar was a noble of Ellyrion, and a marksman of considerable note. It was said his arrows could fly true through stormy winds and still find their mark, even if he took but a moment to aim. Upon hearing this, Arathion, himself a skilled archer - and one burdened by a surfeit of pride - challenged Imollar, a fellow noble of Ellyrion, to an archery contest, staking as a prize the Reaver Bow. So it was nobles from across Ulthuan bore witness to a contest not seen again for generations. As the final arrow found its mark, Imollar was crowned as the greatest archer of all, and Arathion discovered humility - along with the folly of staking his family's treasured heirlooms as wagers in a contest of pride;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_shadow_armour;Shadow armor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_shadow_armour_desc;The Shadow armor was crafted with skills now lost to the High Elves. Some believe it was forged in the hidden camps of Shadow Warriors, whilst others hint it is not Elf make at all, but a gift from Loec, the trickster god. The shimmering armor weighs almost nothing and exist somewhere between the real world and that of magic, allowing its wearer to pass all but unseen by mortal eyes. First to don it was Prince Telmakador, one of the handful of nobles who saw Aethis' reign for the folly it was and fought a bitter campaign of ambush and sabotage against the Dark Elves as the Phoenix Court descended into complacency. Many times did Aethis' agents seek Telmakador's arrest, but each time he was thought cornered, he melded into the darkness and slipped away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_merwyrm_shield;Shield of the Merwyrm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_merwyrm_shield_desc;In the murky deeps far below Lothern's Emerald Gate slumbers Amanar, ancient protector of the city. Only in hours of greatest need does the merwyrm rouse and rise to the surface to consume those who would bring about Lothern's ruin. The records kept in the Glittering Tower tell that Amanar has manifested but three times in recorded history. The first was during the Daemon invasion, where he swallowed a whole legion that laid siege to the city. The second came during the Sundering, where his broad back held Lothern high above the tidal waves that swamped Ulthuan. The third, and to date final, appearance of Amanar came during the Great Incursion. With a great sweep of his tail, he scattered much of the Dark Elf army. Then, ignoring the pinpricks of their blades, he turned and bore the Black Ark Intolerable Delight beneath the waves, never to be seen again. No sight has been of Amanar since that day, but a single great scale was recovered after the battle was done, which now forms the unbreakable heart of this shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_golden_crown_atrazar;Golden Crown of Atrazar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_golden_crown_atrazar_desc;No mere gemstones are set about this circlet, but brilliantly polished shards taken from waystones all across Ulthuan. Thus can the bearer of the Golden Crown draw upon the magics of the Great Vortex to guard himself from harm. Few wear the Golden Crown for long, however, for the souls of the dead hang heavy about its brow, and their whispered praises and encouragements would inflate the wearer's pride to epic proportions, driving even the noblest mortal into a dangerous, self-obsessing madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_moranion_wayshard;Moranion's Wayshard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_moranion_wayshard_desc;In the days of his youth, Moranion - of Athel Tamarha - wandered the realm of Yvresse as one of its Mistwalkers. Few could tread the fog-wreathed paths so surely as he, for he bore a wayshard attuned to the great watchstone at the realm's heart. Thus did Moranion walk the Daemon-haunted mists as easily he would have done under clear skies, leading ambushes of spear and bow to destroy the invaders. Though Moranion now sleeps eternally, his wayshard still glimmers with poer. Those who can unlock its secrets will never again find themselves lost, no matter how far they might stray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_khaine_ring_fury;Khaine's Ring of Fury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_khaine_ring_fury_desc;Khaine once had eight rings, or so the legends tell. Hekarti, Goddess of Magic, designed each of them to embody a single Wind of Magic. Vaul, the Godsmith, wrought them with all his cunning, binding to each a glittering gemstone that shone with the power of the winds. Khaine was much pleased with these gifts, for they gave him a mastery of magic which he had never before known. Yet the Lord of Murder was not to keep his prizes for long. \n \n Neither Hekarti nor Vaul had any love for Khaine, and had fashioned the rings out of fear of reprisal, rather than for filial duty. Moreover they worried for how the godly balance of power would be altered by what they had done. Thus did Hekarti and Vaul, whose love for each other could have filled only the very meanest of vessels, then conspire together to see Khaine divested. So did they tell Atharti, the Lady of Desire and most covetous of all the divine host, of Khaine's new treasures, hoping she would distract the Lord of Murder long enough for the rings to be reclaimed. Atharti immediately resolved to take the rings for her own, but Khaine would not part with them, no matter what seductive wiles she brought to bear. Eventually, they came to blows and, in the process, the rings were lost. To the great dismay of all who sought them, the rings had fallen into the mortal world, where Asuryan's law forbade the gods from treading. Over the centuries that followed, only one ring has been found, the black iron Ring of Fury. It has been brought to the battlefield only at times of greatest need, for no one wields the power of the gods lightly. Fewer still find it wise to so openly taunt the Lord of Murder with his loss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_sunfire_gem;Gem of Sunfire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_sunfire_gem_desc;Bound within this brilliant jewel is the angry essence of Angranir, greatest of the Flamespyre Phoenixes. During the civil war, Angranir was struck down by sorceries meant for Caledor, and neither Priestess of Isha nor learned physician could heal him. So it was that Aeldamar, High Mage of Tiranoc, was instructed to save Angranir's spirit, so that the noble bird's light could bring hope to Ulthuan for years to come. Alas, by then, all that remained of Angranir was a burning brand of magic which, while formidable of temperament, now lacked any of the firebird's intelligence or majesty. Nonetheless, Aeldamar did as he was bid, and preserved the enchanted flame within a many-faceted topaz. Mindless still, Angranir's fire lends its heat to the fires wielded by the bearer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_beard_cloak;Cloak of Beards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_beard_cloak_desc;To many High Elves, the Cloak of Beards is a relic of an unhappy hour. But, for a few, notably those whose ancestors fought in Caledor II's final battle against Gotrek Starbreaker, it is a valued reminder of the perfidiousness of Dwarfs. This latter group ensure that the Cloak of Beards is never lost: indeed, with every generation, it grows longer and more fulsome, as more beards are seized and woven into its folds. Now, its power is such that its mere presence subverts prideful Dwarfen works - even runes cease to function.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_book_hoeth;Book of Hoeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_book_hoeth_desc;The Book of Hoeth is one of Saphery's most treasured artefacts. The very first pages are laid down in the hand of Bel-Korhadris himself, and every subsequent entry bears the seal of the greatest Loremaster of his time. Yet a great many of the Book of Hoeth's pages remain blank, for the scholars of the White Tower are aware that even their knowledge has limits, boundaries that must be driven back if a complete mastery of magic is to be achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_world_dragon_banner;The Banner of the World Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_world_dragon_banner_desc;Elven legends tell that Draugnir, Father of Dragons, was welcomed in Asuryan's court as an equal, for mortal Elves and gods alike were awestruck by his might and nobility. Alas, not all the Elven pantheon were so enamoured. Anath Raema, sister to Khaine and goddess of the savage hunt, saw him as nothing more than an upstart beast to be harried and hunted as any other. \n \n Taking up her spear, she pursued the Dragon through the heavens. The contest that followed shook the world to its core, rousing even wise Asuryan from contemplation. The Creator halted the battle, but came too late to save Draugnir, whose wounds were beyond healing. \n With a single word, Asuryan banished Anath Raema to the Mirai forevermore. From the corpse of his fallen friend, he worked to create a new land where Elves and Dragons could live in peace, beyond the jealousies of the gods. From Draugnir's bones, he forged Ulthuan's mountains, and from the Dragon's flesh he created its broad plains. Draugnir's glittering scales Asuryan gave into the keeping of Isha. She, in turn, passed them to her mortal children, the Elves, who wrought many fabulous works with them, chief amongst them a mighty standard, woven with silver and hung with gems of all shapes and hues. \n \n This Banner of the World Dragon endures to this day, a reminder not only of the bond between the Elves and Dragons, but also of that which binds both races to their ancestral home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_great_eagle_mount;Great Eagle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_great_eagle_mount_desc;The Great Eagles of Ulthuan have always been firm allies to the Elves. The histories tell that the two races have fought in one another's cause since the time of the Daemon invasion, but legend carries the friendship even deeper into the past. Indeed, in some tales, it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial away to the Underworld at Asuryan's command. \n \n Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures who long remember insults, and do not suffer foolish company gladly. When Asur armies assemble, the noble Eagles too join the battle. They swoop down upon the crew of enemy war machines, tearing them apart with powerful talons before using mighty wings to glide swiftly away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_flamespyre_phoenix_mount;Flamespyre Phoenix;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_flamespyre_phoenix_mount_desc;The Phoenixes of Ulthuan dwell amongst the Flamespyres - great alabaster pillars of rock that stand sentinel about the Shrine of Asuryan. These constantly burn with magical flame, for Aqshy gusts about these rocks as it is drawn inexorable towards the Isle of the Dead. Yet Ashqy has left its mark on more than the silent stones. Over generations, the Phoenixes of the Flamespyres have become attuned to fire magic, harnessing it at whim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_frostheart_phoenix_mount;Frostheart Phoenix;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_frostheart_phoenix_mount_desc;As a Flamespyre Phoenix ages, its body cools, amd even begins to sap heat from its surroundings. Finally the plumage that once blazed with fire grows heavy with frost and ice. Once this occurs, the Phoenix must leave the Flamespyres, for the chill that surrounds it causes agony in its brightly burning kin. Most such Frostheart Phoenixes dwell in lonely exile crags about the Eataine coast, until their bodies finally freeze solid, to leave curious frozen statues along the crags and cliff tops. Others return to the Shrine of Asuryan, to offer their final days in service as war-steeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_tiranoc_chariot;Tiranoc Chariot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
asur_artifact_tiranoc_chariot_desc;The Asur of Tiranoc are an adventurous people, proud of their fighting traditions, and deeply embittered by the wars that have ravaged their realm. When the Phoenix King calls his subjects to war, the fiery knights of Tiranoc are always among the first ot answer, riding to battle at the head of a might chariot host. Spear-points and healms gleam in the light of the rising sun, and the ground trembles beneath thundering hooves. Banners of white, gold and blue stream in the wind. As one, the charioteers give voice to the battle hyym of Tiranoc, a rousing and beautiful anthem, sung at the mustering of the host since ancient times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

beastmen_artifact_chaos_armour;Bestial Chaos armor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_chaos_armour_desc;A gift from the Chaos Gods themselves, this armor is comparable to Dwarven Gromril, indeed, such is its strength that only weapons of Arcane origins stand a chance of penetrating this hellish plate. Ornate and weirdly wrought, it is forged from unknown materials that seem to writhe and change before a foeman's very eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_axes_khorgor;Axes of Khorgor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_axes_khorgor_desc;Khorgor was one of the greatest champions of the Beastmen to have ever lived. His axes could hew through flesh and armor with ease and now carry the half-sentient spirit of Khorgor within them. Following his death his axes have been fiercely fought over by the warherds ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_axes_khorgor_offhand;Axes of Khorgor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_axes_khorgor_offhand_desc;Khorgor was one of the greatest champions of the Beastmen to have ever lived. His axes could hew through flesh and armor with ease and now carry the half-sentient spirit of Khorgor within them. Following his death his axes have been fiercely fought over by the warherds ever since.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_black_maul;The Black Maul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_black_maul_desc;This large-hafted weapon ends in a spiked head. Stained black from having bathed in the blood of thousands of victims slain on the field of battle, it seems alive with violence. The spirit of the heavy, unsubtle weapon hungers for blood, and any who carries this weapon for long finds their thoughts ever drifting towards carnage and bloodshed, and eventually find themselves obeying the weapon's longings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_stonecrusher_mace;Stonecrusher Mace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_stonecrusher_mace_desc;This massive, heavy club is ringed with bands of cursed iron, and carries enchantments of shattering and destruction. A great blunt weapon with an iron beasthead at its tip, the Stonecrusher Mace has become a symbol of the Beast men's eternal desire to unmake that which Man has made, and to cast down his civilisation. Though it lacks an edge with which to penetrate armor, those struck by it find their bones turn to powder under the sheer brute force of the blow. Even castle gates have fallen to this weapon in its long and bloody history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_great_fang;Great Fang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_great_fang_desc;This pale sword is crude but sharp. It is clearly made from something other than steel, perhaps bone or ivory. Torn from the maw of a monstrous Shaggoth, it was sharpened by Bray-Shamans for generations until it gained a razor edge. Marked with blasphemous runes of the Beast Tongue, it's noted for its ability to sheer through armor, bone, and flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_fur_sharrgu;Fur of Sharrgu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_fur_sharrgu_desc;This hide is a filthy mess of matted and stinking fur from a Chaos Spawn named Sharrgu. Sharrgu was an enormous Spawn, it was the great despoiler. When the towering beast-spawn was slain, its hide was roughly cut and ripped from its body to make heavy, shaggy cloaks. It was said that Sharggu was impervious to arrows and javelins hurled against it, and so it was believed that the fur could make a champion invulnerable to missiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_ramhorn_helm;Ramhorn Helm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_ramhorn_helm_desc;This ornate headdress has two great curving ram horns that spiral and tighten around the wearer's own horns, allowing the bearer to deliver a devastating headbutt to any enemy that lowers his guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

beastmen_artifact_dark_heart;The Dark Heart;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_dark_heart_desc;This fist-sized dark red gemstone pulses with scarcely contained power and throws beams of crimson light in all directions. The Dark Heart is aptly named for a Beastman Warlord who tore it from the chest of an Elven Wizard before the Coming of Sigmar. So violent was the Elf's death that Khorne crystallised the heart and filled it with the Beastman's wrath. Those under the influence of its power are filled with a longing to kill, and will charge recklessly at the foe, filled with hatefuelled invigoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_beast_banner;The Beast Banner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
beastmen_artifact_beast_banner_desc;This ancient banner is stitched together from pieces of hide hewn from literally hundreds of defeated enemies.

To grasp the lance is said to be the true test of courage and spiritual strength, for an aspirant who is found wanting will be consumed by searing white flame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lance_tier_3_artois;Lance of Artois;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lance_tier_3_artois_desc;The Lance of Artois was the lance used by Folgar of Artois, who became one of Gilles' Grail Companions and was renowned for his skill at the joust. The lance tip remains as sharp as it ever was, despite the passing of time. In times of need, the lance is removed from the Grail Chapel of St. Folgar and bestowed upon a mounted knight for the duration of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

When held in the hand and Manann invoked, the caller is filled with divine energy, though this can be a very draining experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perilous_dart;Perilous Dart;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
perilous_dart_desc;The Perilous Dart was the bolt that struck Gilles down, and which he then used to kill the wyvern, is said to still exist. An item of great power, it drives events around its bearer to a crisis, where he can, by his own efforts, either gain a great victory or suffer a great loss. The bolt does not care about the goals of its holder, and those at a great disadvantage in a struggle for which they care deeply sometimes seek it out, trusting to the crisis to give them a victory otherwise unattainable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

druchii_artifact_hydra_blade;Hydra Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hydra_blade_desc;The Hydra Blade was carved from a single fang of Akholrak, first and greatest of the War Hydras broken to Malekith's service, and like its many-headed namesake, its keen edge srikes repeatedly against its foes. Though Akholrak is dead now, torn asunder long ago by the talons of the great Caledorian Dragon Incalamir, its malice lives on within this gnarled and twisted sword. Only those of iron will can hope to dominate the Hydra Blade, for it is imbued with an echo of Aholrak's malice and is little inclined to suffer the commands of another. Most wielders discover the blade's wilfulness more than offset by its alacrity, but more than a few have perished needlessly in encounters where skill would have served them far better than speed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_chillblade;Chillblade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_chillblade_desc;When Malekith obliterated the northern citadel of Har Kaldra, he offered neither warning nor quarter. The iron-clad fortress was blasted to rime-scarred splinters with a single cataclysmic spell. Ever after, the freezing north wind has wailed with the agonised voices of those who perished that day, and its chill grasp can be held at bay by neither fur nor flame. It was from scattered shards of Har Kaldra that the Chillblade was forged. Its merest touch freezes not only the physical body but also the soul within, leaving the victim paralysed and easy prey for his attacks' next strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_dragon_egg;Black Dragon Egg;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_dragon_egg_desc;In Ulthuan, the egg of a Dragon is sacred, and harsh punishment awaits any who endanger or disturb a Dragon nest. In Naggaroth, a Dragon egg is naught but a potential source of power, and their nests nothing but cradles to nurture that power. So it is that for every Black Dragon Egg that develops into a hatchling, countless dozens more are taken and consumed, so that their devourers might take a portion of the egg's strength as their own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_twilight_cloak;Cloak of Twilight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_twilight_cloak_desc;Woven from the hair of innocents and dyed with the blood of sorcerers, the Cloak of Twilight is all but invisible to the mortal eye. The cloak has served many masters well across the long centuries. It was this garb that allowed Morathi to keep a close watch on the Phoenix Court of Bel Shanaar, even from Nagarythe. Centuries later, it had passed from the Hag Sorceress' hands and became the tool that allowed the master assassin, Venomblade, to stalk the blood-slicked streets of Tor Elyr as he visited his night of Screaming Death upon the folk of that great city. Ownership of the Cloak of Twilight guarantees an ambitious Dark Elf the success he craves, but is not without risk. However determined its wearer, there is always a more ruthless pretender, his mind set to steal the cloak's power for his own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_amulet;The Black Amulet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_black_amulet_desc;Carved from the tortured heartstone of a mountain drenched in Dark Magic, the Black Amulet is a lustrous polished stone of midnight hue. It is engraved with a single glowing rune, and into its ebony facets have been poured all the captured malice and spite that emanates from the chill lands of Naggaroth. To behold its darksome shape is to see despair made physical, it is to abandon even the merest memory of hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hotek_ring;Ring of Hotek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_hotek_ring_desc;Hotek was an outcast priest of Vaul. It was he who forged Malekith's rune-etched armor, and he also oversaw the creation of many of the Witch King's most terrible weapons. Renegade and turncoat though he was, Hotek was no fool. He knew that he lived only at Malekith's fickle pleasure, and so created for himself an armoury of defences - both magical and physical - with which he hoped to blunt the Witch King's wrath long enough to escape. Ultimately, Hotek did not perish at Malekith's hands, but was poisoned on Morathi's order. His armoury was broken up soon after, the scattered pieces changing hands with the ebb and flow of patronage and power. None of the artefacts have known as many masters as the Ring of Hotek, for this trinket of obsidian and black diamond is claimed to be the renegade priest's greatest work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_nagarythe_banner;Banner of Nagarythe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_nagarythe_banner_desc;During the sundering, many of Nagarythe's treasures were lost in battle or destroyed by natural disaster. Those that remained were greedily seized upon by nobles of both allegiances. Some fell into the hands of the Aesanar, who hid them away from Malekith's forces, but the most important were taken by the Dark Elves. The Banner of Nagarythe is the greatest of all such treasures, woven through with silver thread and inlaid with pearls and diamonds. For the Dark Elves, the Banner of Nagarythe is a physical reminder of the injustices heaped upon them by the Phoenix Throne. Moreover, it is the personal standard of the Witch King and proclaims his right to rule not only Naggaroth, but the ten kingdoms of Ulthuan as well. For their part, the Shadow Warriros of Nagarythe deem this banner too mired in corruption and betrayal to any longer have any wholesome purpose. They seek not its return, but its destruction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_spite_gem;The Gem of Spite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_spite_gem_desc;Many Dark Elves feel that a misfortune shared, if not exactly a misfortune havled, then at least one in which they can take a certain malignant (and possible posthumous) glee. Such was the goal behind the creation of the Gem of Spite. It was fashioned during a rare civil war in Ghrond, when sorceress fought sorceress in an attempt to claim a place at Morathi's right hand. The Gem of Spite still turns up from time to time, normally in the possession of one who has fallen from the Hag Sorceress' favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_sacrificial_dagger;The Sacrificial Dagger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_sacrificial_dagger_desc;This dagger is a tiny splinter of the cruel weapon wielded by Hekarti, Goddess of Dark Magic. It was shivered from her blade during a failed attempt to sacrifice her sister, Atharti, to an older and darker power than she. The shard was flung far and came to rest in the caverns beneath Ghrond. Here, amongst the bleached bones and rubble, itwas discovered by Khaeleth the Sorceress. She claimed the dagger as her own and learned how to unlock its power to transmute the soul-essence of living creatures into a raw and hungry magic. So began Khaeleth's rise to the foremost seat of power within the Dark Convent of Ghrond, an elevation marked by blood sacrifice and the darkest of sorceries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_tome_furion;Tome of Furion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_tome_furion_desc;Dark Magic is destruction incarnate - even it most basic precepts are corrosive to mind, body and soul. Few tomes containing its secrets therefore exist, for mere paper and papyrus smoulder to naught within decades of being inked with such sigils. THe tome of Furion is a rare exception to this rule. Its pages are flayed Orc hide, but the book endures its burdens thanks only to the carefully layered enchantments Furion bound into its covers. The letters inscribed within writhe and shift like living creatures, and the pages are warm to the touch even in the dead of winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

druchii_artifact_dark_pegasus_mount;Dark Pegasus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_dark_pegasus_mount_desc;Dark Pegasi make their nests on the northernmost peaks of the Iron Mountains. It is from these eyries that the Druchii steal young Pegasi to serve as steeds - a fully-grown beast is too savage to be trained. The majority of these young Dark Pegasi are sold in Ghrond, for such beasts are favoured as steeds by the Sorceresses of the Dark Convent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_manticore_mount;Manticore;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druchii_artifact_manticore_mount_desc;Druchii hold no creature in higher esteem, for they believe it to be one of the thousand incarnations of Khaine, and daring Beastmasters venture as far north as the Chaos Wastes in search of young Manticores to sell at auction. Manticores can be tamed enough to take a rider, though they remain feral. Even if his steed occasionally ignores his commands and pitches him into unfavourable fights, a Druchii considers this a minor risk compared to the fear and respect such a mount brings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Whenever this blade tastes blood, its wielder seems to exert greater control over the Winds of Magic. Timor Noctis appears to be of Dwarfen craftsmanship yet also bears clear marks of Chaos. During his wanderings of the world, Mannfred journeyed east and met the Chaos Dwarfs of Zhar-Naggrund. Somehow, he convinced them to forge him a sword worthy of his stature, and he has carried it with him ever since.

chaos_artifact_hellfire_sword_desc;The blade known as the Hellfire Sword was made from a single, searing flame that was hammered into material form and quenched in the blood of a fire-djinn. Those struck by it are set ablaze and may explode as their blood turns to liquid fire. The Hellfire Sword was first wielded by the Chaos Lord Garathor but, over time, it consumed his lifeforce until nought remained within his armor but ash. When the Hellfire Sword was prised from Garathor's ruined gauntlet years later, it flared so hotly that it fused into its new owner’s hand. Eventually, this fool’s spirit was also consumed, and the cycle began anew. Since its creation, a hundred mortals have borne this flame-wreathed blade, unaware of their doom until it was too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It was fashioned by the Daemon Warlord Amon 'Chakai, whose fossilised eye is still grasped in the weapon's pommel. The Sword of Change is saturated with the mutating power of Chaos. Even the air around the blade is in flux: at one moment, the blade is wreathed with the scent of sweet perfumes reminiscent of Slaanesh, only to be replaced a heartbeat later with the stench of rot and decay of Nurgle. An eye-blink later and the air around the Sword of Change shines with multicoloured hues of Tzeentch before being surrounded in a haze of misted blood associated with Khorne. This magical sword has the power to reduce those whose flesh it pierces into mindless, flailing mounds of flesh, warping their bodies into monstrosities known as Chaos Spawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_eternal_blade;The Eternal Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_eternal_blade_desc;According to legend, this weapon has been present at every major battle since the dawn of time. It was a sword during the sack of Braquiron, an axe on the slaughter-fields of Naggra. At the Siege if Kislev, it was a spear in the hand of De'voth the Devolved and, after his death, the dagger that stole the life of the Tsar.

chaos_artifact_skull_katam_desc;Upon his death, the Skull of Katam was daubed with runes using the blood of the Chaos Dragon Baudros. The skull continues to utter words of power, and a wizard who listens may learn many arcane secrets. However, every time the bearer consults the skull, there is a chance it will reveal one of the true mysteries of the Realm of Chaos, imparting knowledge that blasts the mind with its scope and impossibility. In time, the skull's whisperings drive its owner insane, reducing him to a drooling madman whose gibberings are joined only by the eerie sound of Katam's laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Its massive head was part hound, part bull, part the incarnate soul of bloody hate.

They float in the clouds of swirling energy that makes up the Realm of Chaos, drifting through the Aethyr, feasting on lower Daemons and the souls of the damned. They are formless things of shadow on this mad plane, vicious and uncaring. They are commanded by their dark master to seek out and destroy the essences of mortals who are pulled into the plane and retrieve their souls for Tzeentch to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The stream of visions can overwhelm the bearer, but those who can sift through the bombardment of images are truly terrifying foes. They attack with preternatural reflexes, foreseeing their foe’s actions and striking them down before they can even raise their swords. The only vision the helm never reveals is the moment of its wearer’s demise, making it impossible for the champion to avoid such a fate. Upon the wearer’s death, a new boil appears on the helm’s surface. In time this bursts, revealing a new eyeball — the exact match of the previous owner — to join the helm’s ever-growing collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

chaos_artifact_nurgle_filth_mace_desc;The rusted Filth Mace drips with Nurgle’s choicest plagues and bears an enchantment that ensnares the souls of those crushed beneath its filth-encrusted mass. The screams of these spirits are deafening and fearsome in equal measure, but they are as nothing compared to the terror caused when a fresh soul is bound to the mace, fuelling an epidemic growth of new disease: the wails turn into phlegm-choked laughter and the steady drip of pestilence becomes a weeping flood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
