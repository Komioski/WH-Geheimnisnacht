warbear_mount;Ursun War Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;x
warbear_mount_desc;There is no creature more important to the Kislevites than the bear. He is more than just the symbol of the land, a god, and his image is more than just a rallying figure for armies and proud citizens. The bear shares his life with the people of the oblast and shares their struggles. When winters are harsh, he goes hungry just as they do. When spring comes again, he takes his young to the river to play just as they do. In summers bloom, he trains his young to hunt, and he hunts as well as any man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
coldone_mount;Cold One Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;x
coldone_mount_desc;Cold Ones are rapacious predators, fuelled by a savage blood-lust that drives them to attack any warm-blooded creature that comes near. Cold Ones hunt in packs, and are perfectly capable of bringing down creatures many times their own size. They are found in many places but are most commonly seen on the continent known as the New World that lies just to the west of Ulthuan. Their habitats range from the tunnels and mountains under Hag Graef in the realms of the Dark Elves, all the way, hundreds of miles south, to the Lustrian jungles that are home to the Lizardmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spider_mount;Giant Spider Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;x
spider_mount_desc;Giant Spiders are deadly hunters, easily capable of ensnaring and overwhelming a fully-grown man. Their toxic venom is deadly to all but the hardiest victim, and few survive for long once bitten. Some particularly old and powerful giant spiders have been known to grow as large as a house, and forest goblin tribes revere these ancient beasts and even ride them to war. Giant spiders can be part of a larger brood, often led by a spider queen, but they are often encountered singly or in small numbers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mammoth_mount;Mammoth Mount;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mammoth_mount_desc;Great mammoths roam the northern tundras, where some Norscan and Ogre tribes hunt them for meat, skins and bones. But some hunt them for war. Capturing one alive and bending it to one's will is no easy task, but if succeeded, the tribe will have a warbeast that can crush buildings and break down the gates of strongholds. Mammoths can be used to break down enemy troops as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chariot_mount;War Chariot;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chariot_mount_desc;Only the greatest and most esteemed warriors were given the rights to ride these ancient warmachines to battle. Their advance is heralded by a cloud of dust thrown high into the air as they drive across the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
