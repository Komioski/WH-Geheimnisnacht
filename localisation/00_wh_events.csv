# AMAZON EVENTS
#
amazon5B;No, let these ones keep roaming free;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon8desc;Once each spring, it is allowed for all Amazons of any caste to mate with men so that new daughters can be born. Do you wish to host a fertility ritual, and put your captive male population to good use?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon8A;Yes, let the ritual be prepared!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon8B;No, maybe next year...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon9desc;Rigg, Goddess of War and Battle does not normally tolerate men in her realm, but tonight her sister Serena will allow an exception. The drums beat, the pace of the dance increases, and as the wine flows, your ceremonial husband for one night is brought before you in chains along with many others for your gathered sisters. You may do as you wish with him and if he does not please you, the Snake-Goddess Serena will welcome his sacrifice after he has performed his final duty for the Amazon Sisterhood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon9A;Come with me, slave...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon10desc;While lying in the prison cell you hear the drums beat, the pace of the dance increases, the laughter upstairs in the palace grow increasingly wild as the wine no doubt flows. Fierce Amazon spearmaidens soon arrive to put you in chains and drag up to the hall along with the others. You are soon brought before an Amazon Priestess, and she leads you towards her private quarters... you have heard rumours that men who displease them during the fertility rites are sacrificed, so your heart is pumping out of your chest...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon10A;Must ... not... disappoint her!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon11desc;You wake up with a smile on your face, sighing contentedly. The slave performed well last night, and you are inclined to let him live on. Yet on the other hand, Serena favours those who sacrifice in her name... especially things they place value on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon11A;Another time perhaps. For now, this one lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon11B;A life for a life, Serena will have his blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon12desc;You wake up with a sneer awoken by the slave's snoring, still tied to your bed. You remember his pathetic performance last night, and the blood lust begins to boil in your veins...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon12A;No, I'm going to be merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon12B;At least I'll enjoy sacrificing this one, and hearing his screams.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon13desc;You wake up tied to the Priestess's bed, and find her smiling down on you. 'Good slave,' she whispers, 'I hope the others let you live too, and I get you next year as well...';;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon13A;Thank the gods, I'm going to live!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon14desc;You wake up tied to the Priestess's bed, and find her sneering face looking down on you. Without a word, you are knocked unconscious by the hilt of a wicked looking dagger and when you come to... you are in the great hall, kneeling before the high priestess. Drums are beating, your head is pounding, Amazons are dancing and cheering behind you, and then a sharp cold pain is felt against your throat. You have no time to scream as the last things you see is a spray of blood pouring out on the ground from your throat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon14A;Ugghhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon15desc;The sacrifices to Serena are brought before the throne. These men have proven themselves worthless. The drums are beating, your sisters are dancing around them, and cheers emanate from the sides of the great hall. Finally you step down behind the slave you bedded last night, savour the look of terror on his face, and then swiftly draw the sacrificial dagger as you move behind him and spray his lifeblood all over the floor. The Creators be praised, let this sacrifice please the Snake-Goddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon15A;Serena be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon17desc;In the eyes of the world, your child is a bastard, but in Amazon culture that is not so. Your child is your legitimate heir, no matter who the father is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon17A;That is the proper way of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon18desc;You have been told previously that you are an exception, and do not have to be a slave in the Amazon hierarchy. Yet you find yourself in prison along with the others...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon18A;I will appeal to my jailers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon19desc;You are asked to visit one of your captives in the dungeon. He looks at you appealingly: 'Please, I was promised that I was an exception and could roam freely... why am I locked up here with all the others?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon19A;Ahh, that is correct my pet. Sisters, release this one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon19B;We lied. You will stay where you belong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon20desc;Your host comes down to your cell, and smiles at your predicament. 'You're right, pet, we did say you could walk freely. Sisters - release this one at once!';;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon20A;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon21desc;Your host comes down to your cell, and smiles at your predicament. 'Remember when we said that you could walk freely amongst us? We lied.' With that, the Amazons laugh darkly and leave you alone once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon21A;Wait, please, come back!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon22desc;Your top liege is an Amazon, and in Amazon realms men are forbidden from holding or inheriting titles unless they are a very rare exception.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon22A;Curse this unjust and purely socially constructed order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon23desc;Your top liege is no longer Amazon, so you can now inherit normally again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon23A;Gender equality at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon0desc;As a member of the Amazon people, your succession must be enatic. Males cannot be allowed to threaten the ruling order by holding independent power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon5desc;One or more males are running around freely in your court. This cannot be allowed to stand. They must be sent to the guarded male dorms immediately and put to good use!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon5A;Yes, immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon6desc;You have walked as a free man amongst the Amazons, but no more. A group of spear maidens seize you, and on orders of their mistress, drag you to the dungeons where a new life of slavery awaits you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon6A;Nooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7desc;You have given birth to a male child. By the laws of your people, he must either be prepared for sacrifice, or slavery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7A;He will be sent to the dungeons and be a slave.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7B;This one will be sacrificed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7C;I *am* the law! My sons will live free amongst us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2001;You're finally old enough to start your Amazon training and you couldn't be more excited. You've heard a lot of the exploits of the older sisters of your tribe and can't wait to be a proper huntress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2001;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2002;You're finally old enough to start your Amazon training, but, although you have good intentions, it seems you just can't manage to keep up with the tasks that are assigned to you. It's as if you're not strong enough to be a proper Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2002;I must make it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2003;You've been battered with all this nonsense about female supremacy and Amazonian toughness and bravery from your entire childhood. Now you should start training to become like all the other brainwashed sisters, but the truth is, you've no intention to comply with any of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2003;I'll find my own path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] sure looks excited to start [From.GetHerHis] training and become a proper Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3001;That's the spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3001;Then she can work it out on her own…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] should start to train as a proper Amazon, she's old enough to do it, but she really doesn't seem to have what it takes, regardless of her efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3002;We'll just have to try harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3002;She's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3003;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] should start to train as a proper Amazon, but she seems to resist every attempt at teaching her the superior values of your culture, ignoring or criticizing anything her elders tell her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3003;I'll whip her in place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3003;She's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4;You're finally out in the wilderness, following the your elder sisters in the hunts. The Jungle is a scary and dangerous place, but you're growing more confident at each expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4;I'm not scared of the dark trees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4001;You've started sending your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] out with some of the huntresses, so that she may start learning how to stalk the easier game. The little Amazons seems to be going fine, growing confident in her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild4001;*Berate her for her recklessness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild4001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4002;[From.GetFirstName] listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle with great interest and complimented you for your bravery in the face of the dangerous task you were part of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4002;I'll be the best Amazon ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4003;[From.GetFirstName] listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle, but she didn't look very happy about it. She disciplined you for your recklessness, telling you an Amazon, even if without fear, shouldn't brazenly go against any danger without thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4003;But I thought..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4004;[From.GetFirstName] barely listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle. It seems your steady heart was not enough to obtain her approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4004;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4005;Your [GetFromRelation] was very excited of your praise and promised to keep pushing her limits more and more at every next expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4005;Good girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4006;Your [GetFromRelation] was saddened by your disapproval. She has started to act more cautiously, sometimes even trying to aviod going out with the huntresses, but it's hard to say if it'll stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4006;It better be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4007;Your [GetFromRelation] seemed to have interpreted your lack of interest as displeasure. She keeps going hunting with her elder sisters, but is growing more and more frustrated in her attempts to impress you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4007;That's good for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5;Training alongside other girls, competing with each other, going out with the elders to learn how to hunt, everything is making you feel more open and included amongst your sisters. You might not be related by blood, but you share a kindred spirit and only together can you survive in the jungle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5;We're in this together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is growing more talkative and friendly. Spending a lot of time with other girls of her age, talking and training together has opened her and allowed her to find a place in the younger community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild5001;*Berate her for not focusing on her training*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild5001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5002;Your [GetFromRelation] seems very pleased of seeing you interact and make friends with the other young Amazons, teaching you about the importance of friendship and cohoperation amongst the daughters of Serena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5002;I'm glad to be a part of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5003;Your [GetFromRelation] has disciplined you today for wasting so much time with your friends in useless activities, when you should have focused only on your training. You are training to become a strong ruler, the other girls are not your allies, they're in competition with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5003;I.. I won't forget this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5004;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't really seem to mind of your friends and the time you spend with them. You're not sure if this is a good or a bad sign. The other girls told you not to worry about it, but you're unsure what to make of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5004;Is it.. good? Bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5005;Your [GetFromRelation] was emboldened by your acceptance of her new friends and has started spending more and more time out, training, talking, becoming her own woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5005;I'm proud of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5006;Your [GetFromRelation] was confused at first by your complaints about her behavior, but has now slowly started to avoid her new friends, trying to focus entirely on her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5006;She better keep at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5007;Your [GetFromRelation] still spends a lot of time with her friends. With your lack in interest in her situation, she has started to rely on them to get her opinion from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5007;Hm, whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6;You really want to become a strong and famous Amazon when you grow up, but this training is just exhausting. Since some time now, you've tried to avoid some of the sessions, just to take some time to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6;I'm not really lazy…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6001;Despite her willingness to train and her staunch trust in the Amazonian ways, [From.GetFirstName] has grown lazy in the last weeks. She might have been excused for a few days, but now it's becoming too much. She's not going to grow into a fit and able woman by sitting on her behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild6001;*Berate her for her lazyness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild6001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6002;You were relieved to hear from your [GetFromRelation] there's nothing wrong in taking some breaks between training. You'll just lay back for a while, recover your forces, and start your training, good as new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6002;Just a few more days…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6003;Your [GetFromRelation] was not as understanding as you expected of your time off. She dragged you off your room this morning and had you run across the village from the entire day as a first compensation for your lost time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6003;But I'm so tired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6004;Your [GetFromRelation] has not complained about your time off of training for now. On the other hand, you are starting to feel a bit guilty about waisting so many days. Perhaps it's time to go back to your previous schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6004;Yes, maybe so…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6005;Your [GetFromRelation] was relieved by your understanding of her needs. She now spends even more time skipping sessions and slacking at home, sleeping or eating for most of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6005;Perhaps I should have been more strict…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6006;You made clear your stance to your [GetFromRelation]. Hopefully she has learned now to not slack off on her training. Especially if you are her trainer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6006;She'd better have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6007;Your [GetFromRelation] still tends to waste more time at home than she should. Hopefully she'll grow tired of it eventually and get back on schedule for her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6007;Whenever she feels more comfortable…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6008;You've lost track of most of the friends you made in training, but you've found other at home, to spend days speaking. It was already for the best to stop training. Even though you might have gained a little weight, at least you don't have to drag yourself home exhausted every night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6008;Hmm…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6009;All this slacking off and skipping training and hunts is not being good for [From.GetFirstName]. She's grown lazy and fat, wasting her days sitting on her growing behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6009;That's pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7;Sometime it's friendly fights, sometimes.. not. But you like it, whether you win or lose, in the end it's all for your benefit and the training right? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7;It's just costing a tooth every while…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is growing into quite the spirited girl, picking fights with the other trainees, returning home half of the times with a sore eye or a missing tooth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild7001;*Berate her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild7001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7002;You were excited to hear of your [GetFromRelation]'s approval of your belligerant attitude. Not that it would matter, after all, if she said anything against it, you would have made her change her mind, one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7002;Damn right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7003;You were very upset when your [GetFromRelation] yelled at you for acting so violently for such allegedly insignificant reasons. You would have striked her, if she didn't look so scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7003;Maybe next time I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7004;Your [GetFromRelation] has ignored your black eyes for now. You're fine with it, after all, what's her business what you do when you're out? You just need to get better at it, that way only the other girls will return sore at their home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7004;That's it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7005;[From.GetFirstName] seemed very happy for your endorsement. Last day she started a fight with a girl two years older just to impress you as you were passing by. She didn't win, but still, it was a notable brawl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7005;That's my girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7006;[From.GetFirstName] was as furious as you were when you disciplined her about keeping her nerves in check. It was a bad evening, but hopefully she has learned her lession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7006;It better be so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7007;[From.GetFirstName] is keeping to get in some nasty fights. At this point it might be just to catch your attention, as you could swear she's getting more and more violent against her unlucky victims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7007;So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8;You just can't help it: you do your best, but every time you get into a fight, the other girls end up beating you. Some of the other young Amazons have started purposefully picking up on you, to the point you've become afraid of even leaving your home to go training anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8;I don't wanna!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8001;Some girls have started picking up on your [GetFromRelation], beating and mocking her for her weakly demeanor. They have no fault, of course, but [From.GetFirstName] rather than toughen up and answer in kind, seems to be growing more and more craven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild8001;*Berate her for her cowardice*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild8001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8002;[From.GetFirstName] was very understanding with you, giving a hard talk to the other mean girls and allowing you to spend some days home from time to time. It's a little embarassing to be protected by a grown up, but at least you're not getting beaten anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8002;Yes, at least that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8003;Your [GetFromRelation] proved to be no more understanding than those bullies: she striked and disciplined you, telling you the problem is not with them but with you and that you must be strong if you want to ever become a true Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8003;But..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8004;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't really seem to care about your problems. She barely listened when you told her about the bullies and dismissed the whole thing as something for you to solve on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8004;But..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8005;Reassuring and helping [From.GetFirstName] with those bullies certainly calmed her down, although you wonder if this will help her in the long run becoming a good Amazon…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8005;At least she feels safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8006;The bullies are still picking up on [From.GetFirstName], but at least now she answers in kind from time to time. Hopefully she'll manage to get over it, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8006;She better be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8007;You don't know what is happening with [From.GetFirstName] and those bullies, nor you care. Probably things are still bad, giving a look on how she comes back home in the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8007;Well, that's on her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9;There are so many things that you can do wrong and having all the eyes of the other better trainees pointed on you make you just feel uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9;Can't I train alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9001;Your [GetFromRelation] is going through a streak of shyness it appears. She feels insecure and fears the judgement of her peers, thus trying to avoid any social meating with the girls of her age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild9001;*Berate her for her cowardice*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild9001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9002;You're glad your [GetFromRelation] is allowing you your space in this delicate time. There's nothing wrong with you after all, you just like to be alone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9002;There's nothing wrong at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9003;Your [GetFromRelation] acted really mean in these days, trying to force you to train with the other girls, embarassing you and putting you on the spot. You don't know how could you possibly ever fight alongside this strangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9003;I just want to be left alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9004;Your [GetFromRelation] is ignoring you, you couldn't ask for anything better. If she doesn't call you up on your shyness, then why should anyone else? Or why should you care about it if they do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9004;Good, good…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9005;Enabling [From.GetFirstName] might not have been a good idea. While she seems more calm now that she's not pressured into social activities, she might be losing on some fundamental lessons on the Amazonian way of life. If she's ever to become a leader, she can't keep hiding behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9005;We'll see…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9006;Forcing [From.GetFirstName] into the social life of a girl her age might be troubling for her now, but you're confident she will learn a valuable lesson and become accustomed to work and fight alongside other Amazons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9006;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9007;[From.GetFirstName] still keeps for herself, trying to avoid other girls of her age, always remaining in silent unless explicitly asked something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9007;That's on her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10;You knew it would happen. You tried really hard, but you knew deep down that you were not worthy: today you fought with some other sisters during your training and ended up being seriously injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10;And we weren't even using real weapons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10001;This is terrible. [From.GetFirstName] somehow managed to get hurt in a training today without even using real weapons. Now she's in her room, moaping, with her arm wrapped in leaves and cloth, incapacitated for at least a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10001;*Let her recover*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild10001;*Force her to train anyway*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild10001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10002;You were relieved to know your [GetFromRelation] would allow you a full recovery before sending you back to training. At least she was understanding of your pain. Perhaps next time you'll do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10002;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10003;Nobody could have denied the gravity of your injury, yet [From.GetFirstName] was ready to kick you back into the fields before even a week. The arm still hurts really badly, but you must ignore the pain and keep exercising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10003;Hnn.. It hurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10004;Your [GetFromRelation] did not even visit you once. On one hand, at least you're being left to heal in peace, on the other your own [GetFromRelation] knows you're suffering and still doesn't feel like visiting you at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10004;Does she hates me so much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10005;[From.GetFirstName] was relieved of hearing you would have let her heal without fretting her. Now she's fully recovered and ready to return to her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10006;[From.GetFirstName] still hurts and sometimes returns home bleeding from her wound, but what are you supposed to do? A true Amazon must learn to ignore the pain and fight her way through, that's what's what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10006;No doubt about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10007;You'd think letting her rot in that bed without bothering her would have at least made her happy, but [From.GetFirstName] seems still sad for some reason beyond the wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10007;That's her problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11;You try your best, but everything turns out wrong for you. You just can't manage to make it as an Amazon. It's all wrong, everybody is against you. You just want to dig a hole and die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11;I want to dieee!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11001;[From.GetFirstName] has grown so frustrated by her recent failures during the training she's started spending her nights brooding and crying in a corner of her room. While she's right to be ashamed of herself, this is hardly the way she'll solve her problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild11001;*Berate her for her weakness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild11001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11002;You don't want to go out, you don't want to train. Your [GetFromRelation] might have tried to be nice with you, but it only made you feel even more ashamed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11002;There is no point in going on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11003;Life is so unfair. Your [GetFromRelation] wouldn't even grant you to sleep to death and dragged you out, forcing you into the training sessions once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11003;Noo! Let me die!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11004;[From.GetFirstName] ignores your pain, but why shouldn't she? You are pathetic after all. A useless reject of an Amazon who will never accomplish anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11004;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11005;You tried to be kind with [From.GetFirstName], but it might have ended up in the opposite of the desired effect: she still wastes herself away in solitude and self-loathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11005;That's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11006;[From.GetFirstName] maybe crying and moping, but at least she has a reason to now. You will keep on pushing her out physically for as long as needed until she gets her act up together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11006;Only way to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11007;Your [GetFromRelation] is still crying in some corner, probably. She really is a lost cause. She has the chance to learn from a great teacher and be an Amazon, what more does she need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11007;It's hopeless…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11008;You've stopped going out altogether, you barely eat, you avoid the light and spend your nights crying at the moons. There is no point in going on. You never really had a chance at becoming an Amazon. That's the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11008;It is…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11009;[From.GetFirstName] is still brooding. She hasn't done any progress and all this laying motionless for days and skipping meals made her weak and sickly. This pale skeletrical creature has nothing of an Amazon's pride or look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11009;Nothing at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12;These ideas of having a society revolve entirely on war and violence is sick and wrong. You've taken your stand today on the field and refused to touch any of the training weapons. Sure, the teacher beat you and the other girls made fun of you, but you know you're standing for what's right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12;And I won't stand down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12001;That [From.GetFirstName]… Today she refused to fight during the training session, standing up to the elders and ignoring her sisters' mocking her. The spoiled brat thinks dedicating her life to the art of war and hunt is a waste of time and, for some reason, 'wrong'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12001;Well, she makes some good points…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild12001;What!?! Violence is a sacred principle of our society!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild12001;Psh, that won't make her last long, for sure…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12002;You were suprised when your [GetFromRelation] supported your stance. Perhpas not all grownups are dumb, violent she-beasts as you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12002;Maybe I can find others who agree with me! Change the system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12003;It didn't really come as a surprise when your [GetFromRelation] started shouting and pulling you around for your behavior in the field. She's like all the others, blinded by bigotry and anger. It just frustrates you to no end to have to share your life with such troglodites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12003;I'd rather die than be you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12004;You expected more of a fuss from your [GetFromRelation] after your behavior in the fields. It seems she has decided to just ignore you. Like you'd care what she thinks, if she ever thinks at all in that numb skull of hers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12004;I'll just find someone who WILL listen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12005;[From.GetFirstName] is really set in her ideas it seems. Now that you conceded her some points, she won't stop talking about how the whole way of living of Amazonia is skewed and wrong. She even found other girls in the tribe who share her ideas and started spredding this impure thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12005;That's.. hm, that's not very good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12006;It's like talking to a wall. Your [GetFromRelation] won't just understand the basic principle that being unable to defend yourself in Lustria means dying young. She thinks it'd be better for her to die with her ideas than learn out to throw a spear. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12006;That's just stupid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12007;[From.GetFirstName] is still spewing her nonsense about peaceful coexistance and non-violence. You won't dignify any of that rubbish, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12007;Let her have at it, she'll come around…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13;It just hit you: what's the point of training at all? All Amazons train for is fighting, to breed more senseless violence, cultivating an absurd standard of living and body. Why should you sweat and suffer for it when you think it's wrong? You should break tradition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13;No more training!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13001;Having to put up with her seditious ideas was already enough, but now [From.GetFirstName] has decided to just stop training entirely! She thinks it cultivates a sick and unobtainable standard, whatever that means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13001;Maybe she has a point…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild13001;One way or the other, she WILL sweat before night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild13001;Whatever she says, I guess…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13002;Your [GetFromRelation]'s support was unexpected, but no less pleasing. You must break the shackles of tradition, go completely against the ideal of Amazonian fitness. Which incidentally is something you really enjoy doing. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13002;It's all for the good of our culture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13003;Your [GetFromRelation] had to fight and drag you on her back, kicking and screaming, to the fields to have you train again. She striked and yelled at you and did so much that, by the end of the day, you were more tired than you would have been if you trained. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13003;And she's saying she'll do this every day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13004;Your [GetFromRelation] didn't say anything after your decision to stop training altogether. You know she's playing some trick with you, as if you could fall for it. You will keep doing what you feel it's right, to free Amazons from their primitive traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13004;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13005;[From.GetFirstName] spends her day at home, pontificating about the wrongness of Amazonian ideals while stuffing her face with the meat provided by restless huntresses and countless of hours of stalking. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to enable her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13005;She seemed so certain of it…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13006;That's the only way to treat a spoiled child: violence. Sooner or later [From.GetFirstName] will understand that that should be her first, second and last answer to everything. For now, you're satisfied with having had her kick and scream and pull for the whole day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13006;Not training per se, but tiring enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13007;[From.GetFirstName] can make all the excuses she wants for her lazyness, she's not going to sway you. If wasting her life accomplishing nothing is what she desire, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13007;It's her life after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13008;You clean off some sauce from your bulging belly and go back at eating. It's amazing how quickly you managed to revert whatever effect the first training might have had on you. As you keep getting fatter each day, you show the true wrongness of Amazonian ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13008;I'm sure of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13009;[From.GetFirstName] has really let herself go, following all those frivolous ideas about standards and abstract concepts. If she'd really been smart, she'd have trained along the other girls and become a strong and fit Amazon, rather than a bloated frog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13009;It's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14;Not only Amazons spend all that time fighting and hunting, they force those poor males into prisons for no reason at all, using them like cattle and killing them without a tought nor mercy. These are creatures with feelings and emotions! You can connect with them, speak with them.. love them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14;I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14001;Nothing but blapshemy from [From.GetFirstName], as usual. Tonight she was found making out with one of the males in the stock. When you brought her own she had the gall to say she loved him and that she would free all of them one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14001;It's a bad business, but.. It's the way things are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild14001;You don't know what you say, stupid girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild14001;Whatever, see if I care…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14002;While [From.GetFirstName] wasn't entirely against you, it was clear you won't find support and help for the oppressed men from her. She is, after all, like the others. You'll just need to be more discreet in future with your nightly escapades in the male stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14002;Something the train is good for, finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14003;You knew [From.GetFirstName] would have forbidden to go to the stock again, but you couldn't imagine she could have had your love slaughtered by her huntresses! Now how could you go there again? Even if you found another one, she'd kill him to. Are you destined to live a loveless live?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14003;It can't be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14004;Your [GetFromRelation] must have been fed up entirely with you if she didn't even react after being told you were found kissing a male in the livestock. This can only mean you're making a difference: others would have screamed, acted violently or hypocritically, but she was just speechless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14004;I'm making a difference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14005;You thought you had convinced [From.GetFirstName], but rumors still run she is keeping her unnatural sympathies for the males, as if she could change their position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14005;It's just a child's dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14006;You had to have the male killed, such activities would have brought ruin upon you as well otherwise. Rigg does not tolerate males in her home. [From.GetFirstName] will get over it, eventually, and understand why was it right to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14006;And she'd better do it fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14007;Probably your [GetFromRelation] is still going out at night, meeting her male friends. She will grow bored with their gruff charms and caresses soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14007;Never too soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15;Why should you be trapped in this backwater savage society? You aspire for much more than hunting and fighting. There is a better world out there, you only need the courage to leave this broken life behind and start anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15;And so I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15001;This is unheard of! It was bad already to have that attitude, but now [From.GetFirstName] has disappeared! She escaped, leaving a message telling you she will never become an Amazon and has fled to a better world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15001;It's her life after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild15001;This will NOT stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15002;You were too quick and too smart for your jailers. You've left your home and the ruins with nobody catching you. You finally have a chance to do what you always wanted! Your whole life is ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15002;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15003;You barely reached the boundaries of your tribe's territory when two hunters jumped on you, dragging you back to your [GetFromRelation] in the darkness of night. She disciplined you once more, making it clear escaping will never be an option for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15003;I HATE YOU!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15005;[From.GetFirstName] is too far now. She wanted so much to be free, let's hope at least she makes something good of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15005;Hm, I doubt that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15006;She may be screaming and swearing eternal hate upon you, but [From.GetFirstName] is back. It wasn't hard to track her down. It's only a matter of time until she realize what her destiny really is and accepts it with gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15006;As it is for all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16;You've prepared your whole life for this day. It has come the time to test yourself, go alone in the jungle, prove your worth and be accepted by your tribe as a full-fledged Amazon. You feel confident in your abilities, you've been trained exactly for this, but you cannot hide a hint of fear alongside the anticipation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsamazonchild16;You tried the best you could, despite all your limitations, and the time has come for the final test, to go alone in a hunt and return with a prize worthy of yourself. Then, if you've survived, you'll be an Amazon. You're scared and stressed and dearly hope to not be a shame for your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsamazonchild16;You couldn't believe they would try you anyway, after all you've said and done you thought you'd made pretty clear those traditions mean nothing to you. Yet, once again, you're forced against your will to go on a hunt, alone this time, and return with a prize worthy of you, so that you may be an Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDsamazonchild16;At this age an Amazon should go alone in the jungle and prove her worth, but you can't. You've missed your mark and will never become a fully fledged Amazonian huntress like all the other sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16;Time to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild16;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16001;By not being able to even partake in the final trial, your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has brought shame on your family. As her mother, you are also sharing in this failure more than anybody else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16001;I have failed her and Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16003;You tried your best, but the goddesses must have not been with you today. As the night comes, you return empty-handed to your village. You've shamed your family and denied yourself the chance to be a real Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16003;I'm a disgrace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16004;[From.GetFirstName] has failed in her rite of passage to become a true Amazon. As her mother, you share this shame forever, for her failings as a huntress are your failings as a teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16004;I am disgraced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17;You've passed the final trial! You return head-high to the village carrying your gruesome trophy and are welcomed by the cheers of your sisters. It is now time for you to follow the elders deep into the ruins of the great temple and perform the final rite which will turn you into a real Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17;I'm ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17001;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n It starts like nothing, you start feeling your clothes getting tighter as your frame grows wider and tougher. You get back on your feet, with a light head. All your worries are gone, it's all very simple: you're an Amazon, strong and deadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17001;Awesome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17002;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n It's just a tickle on your skin and only seeing your reflection in the water makes you realize how pretty you've become. You get back on your feet, with a light head. All your worries are gone, it's all very simple: you're an Amazon, beautiful and deadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17002;Awesome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17003;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge from the pool smaller than you entered it. But you know soon enough this is no mistake: your body might have suffered, but you can see everything more clearly now, your dedication to Amazonia stronger than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17003;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17004;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge unchanged from the pool. But this is no mistake: you can feel unearthly energy flow through you and one of the shamans startles as she realizes and tells you the Goddess gave you her greatest gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17004;Eternal youth..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17005;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple, strong and imposing like never before, a true testament to Amazonian superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17005;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17006;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple, beautiful beyond compare, a true testament to Amazonian superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17006;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17007;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple with the small body of a child, but the elders soon calm the crowd and yourself down, explaining how the goddess decided to give her a special more subtle gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17007;I guess it's alright.. but still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17008;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple accompanied by the cheering of the elders themselves, chanting her as blessed by the Snake-Goddess with eternal youth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17008;I'm the mother of a demigoddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17009;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge unchanged from the pool. But this is no mistake: you can feel unearthly energy flow through you and one of the shamans startles as she realizes and tells you the Goddess gave you the gift of magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17009;I'm a shaman?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17010;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple surrounded by unearthly energies, as the elders announce the Goddess gave her magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17010;My little shaman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18;Amazonian society only barely tolerates men for their need as breeding stock, but still, a girl of your age starts to have needs. You've started to think perhaps you are searching in the wrong way. Maybe one of your training mates could fill the longing you feel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18;I'll ask her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18001;Amazonian society only barely tolerates men for their need as breeding stock, but still, a girl of your age starts to have needs. You've started to think perhaps you are searching in the wrong way. Your friend [From.GetFirstName] must think the same and has attempted some clumsy advances to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18001;Yes, this sounds like fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild18001;You're really not my type, sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18002;You were so relieved to know [From.GetFirstName] shares your feeling for her. Now you can help each other and explore this new realm of possibilities without fearing the scorn of the goddesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18002;It'll be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18003;You were saddened to hear [From.GetFirstName] reject your advances. Perhaps this is not the way either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18003;But.. what then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18004;It appears your daughter [From.GetFirstName] has found her happiness with another girl, [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. She has proved once more, a true Amazon doesn't really need men for anything but breeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18004;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild18;It's not a good idea…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTTITLEasrai1;The Oak of Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai1;As days go by, you've felt drawn closer to the heart of Athel Loren, the Oak of the Ages. You've finally embraced the call of the Gods and, as you enter the the ancient tree, you feel the benevolence and wisdom of Isha filling your very being. What happens later is indescribable, but when you've come out you've become more than a mere elf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai1;As days go by, you've felt drawn closer to the heart of Athel Loren, the Oak of the Ages. You've finally embraced the call of the Gods and, as you enter the the ancient tree, you feel the wrath and righteousness of Kurnous filling your very being. What happens later is indescribable, but when you've come out you've become more than a mere elf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai1;Let my enlightened guide shine over my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai1;Let the Wild Hunt start anew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai2;Winter is coming closer and once again you feel the call of the Oak of Ages, to rest inside the heart of Athel Loren and wait for your forces to be renewed on spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai2;Winter is coming closer and once again you feel the call of the Oak of Ages, to burn, die and be reborn from  the heart of Athel Loren in spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCasrai2;The summer is coming to an end and you feel more and more tired everyday. The call of Athel Loren compels you to yield to your torpor and sleep until the next spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai2;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai2;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai2;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai3;With the spring giving new life and colour to the woods, you emerge once more from your sleep, reinvigorated by the power of Athel Loren, once more ready to defend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai3;The Hunt draws close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai4;Something is wrong. You've awakened with a strange thirst for blood this year. The minds of all the Great Hunters are shrieking inside your mind, demanding for you to protect the sacred glades and slaughter all those who are planning to do harm upon them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai4;Blow the horns! It is time we hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai5;This year Kurnous has come back to life maddened with lust for blood. Already his call resonates over the glades, calling all the creatures of the forest to hunt, driving spirits and beasts insane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai5;Blreaaarh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai5;The horns pierce my ears!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai5;What's all this ruckus about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai6;The Weave is out of balance. Day after day you hear whispers and shrieks beneath your bark, it becomes harder to focus, to keep calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai6;Blreaaarh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai8;Athel Loren is not kind on those who fail to respect and preserve its boundaries. The branches and leaves twist and reach out by their own will and by the blink of an eye, part of your hold has disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai8;What- where...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai9;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai9;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai10;You search your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for days, losing four more scouts to the treacherous forest, before finally admitting defeat. The terrible and ancient spirits of Athel Loren claimed [From.GetHerHim], your blasphemy has condemned your [GetFromRelation] to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai10;Why!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai11;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai11;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai12;After the third day of your [GetFromRelation] avoiding you, you finally manage to discover what was the cause of [From.GetHerHis] shyness. The spirits, angered by your actions, have carved their resentment into [From.GetHerHis] face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai12;This is... Oh-ugh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai13;Wondering in the woods of Athel Loren by yourself is not the most sensible action. Yet there you are, unaware of how or why did you leave the glade of your [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai13;Where am I? Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai14;You search your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for days, losing four more scouts to the treacherous forest, before finally admitting defeat. The terrible and ancient spirits of Athel Loren claimed [From.GetHerHim], your blasphemy has condemned your [GetFromRelation] to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai14;Your young innocent [GetFromRelation] has disappeared. The cruel and terrible spirits of Athel Loren claimed what was more dear to you to punish you for your blasphemy, condemning the poor soul to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai14;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai15;You awake in your bed, something rasping under the sheets. You cannot see nor touch your attacker, but at the same time you feel its cold claws pierce their way beneath your flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai15;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai16;You awake in your bed, something rasping under the sheets. You cannot see nor touch your attacker, but at the same time you feel its cold claws pierce their way beneath your flesh, searching for your eyes and your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai16;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai17;You awake in your bed, something rasping under the sheets. You cannot see nor touch your attacker, but at the same time you feel its cold claws pierce their way beneath your flesh, breaking bones and maiming limbs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai17;Grlllbllch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai18;Wandering in the woods of Athel Loren by yourself is not the most sensible action. Yet there you are, unaware of how or why did you leave the safety of your hold. Voices whisper and a faint laughter echoes through the leaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai18;Where am I? Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai19;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai19;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai20;You search your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] for days, losing four more scouts to the treacherous forest, before finally admitting defeat. The terrible and ancient spirits of Athel Loren claimed [From.GetHerHim], your blasphemy has condemned your [GetFromRelation] to forever roam the timeless glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai20;Why!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai21;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been plagued by nightmares and visions since [From.GetHerHim] angered the ancient spirits which roam within Athel Loren. The capricious forces of the forest have now decided to release their wrath against you as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai21;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai22;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been missing for some days. Many in the court have come to the conclusion [From.GetSheHe] has been taken by the spirits of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai22;It'll probably come back sooner or later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai23;You cannot sleep, you cannot think, the shrieking voices of the angered spirits follow your steps at every turn. As days pass by, you feel losing your grip on sanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai23;Leave me alone! Alone!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai24;The spirits of Athel Loren are mysterious and capricious entities, all too ready to kill and twist any creature that dares entering their holy woods. You can only hope an offering could placate them, for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai24;A great offering for our friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai24;The greatest gift for our friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai24;I've changed my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai25;It is hard to read the forest's disposition, but as your offering vanishes, you can feel the Weave resonates with approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai25;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai26;It is hard to read the forest's disposition. In a day, your offering has disappeared, but not sign has come from the spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai26;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai27;Your end has not come yet. Inflamed by your righteous anger, your spirit flew back to the heart of Athel Loren, to be reborn from the hulk of a deadwood as twisted Tree Kin, ready to exact vengeance upon your enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai27;Raahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai28;It has become harder and harder to recall the memories of your previous life. The call of the forest is ever stronger and you feel your conciousness finally going away, merging with the Weave of the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai28;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai29;It has become harder and harder to recall the memories of your previous life. The call of the forest is ever stronger but you feel you could still maintain yourself apart from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai29;It is time to join the Weave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai29;It's not my time yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai31;You've stained your hands with the blood of Isha, such a blasphemous act echoes across the Weave, setting the spirits into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai31;You've stained your hands with the blood of Kurnous, such a blasphemous act echoes across the Weave, setting the spirits into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCasrai31;You've stained your hands with the blood of a spirit, such a blasphemous act echoes across the Weave, setting the other entities of Athel Loren into a frenzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai31;What have I done!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai31;Bleaarrk'k'k'k!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai32;[FromFrom.GetFirstName], one of the mysterious and treacherous Fair Folk, has taken hold of your [GetFromRelation], with no intention of ever giving [From.GetHerHim] back to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai33;You've spent so much time within the magic and mysterious lands of the Elves, that it's hard to remember any other life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai33;Where I belong to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai34;Now that your ward is reaching adulthood, you've started to notice how the once delicate features of the child have started being spoiled by the obscene traits of [From.GetHerHis] lesser nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai34;Send this thing back from whence it came.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai34;I'm still fond of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai36;You've brought your glorious host through the province of [From.GetName]. What should be done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai36;Let nothing stand in our way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai36;Dread carefully in these foreign lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai37;The merciless riders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have wrought destruction and ruin in your lands, destroying any building they came across and hunting down people like beasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai37;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai38;The merciless riders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have wrought destruction and ruin in [FromFrom.GetName], destroying any building they came across and hunting down people like beasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai38;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai36;Pick the interesting ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai39;The merciless riders of [From.GetTitledFirstName] have wrought destruction and ruin in your lands, hunting down the people like beasts, rounding up some of them and leaving in a magical mist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai39;Monsters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai44;The great and old [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has shown interest in your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName]. It's clear the spirit desires to drag [From.GetHerHim] forever in the depths of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai44;All, to our friends from beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai44;No, not [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai41;An old spirit from the depths of the forest has decided to honour your glade with its presence, bringing the might of its host to your defences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai41;And we graciously thank our new friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai46;Your disrespectful attitude has angered on of the old spirits resting within your glade to the point of [From.GetHerHim] deciding to leave in disgust, along with [From.GetHerHis] host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai46;I'm so sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai47;An elusive and sombre group of Elves passed by one of your camps last evening, informing one of your captains that they will join your forces against a common enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai47;We welcome any help from our distant cousins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasrai47;Welcome, friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasrai47;As if some small help will make us forget!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasrai47;Who are these people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai49;The spirits have been deaf to your call. Nobody came.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai49;They have abandoned us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai50;A host of saplings and dryads appears from the forest, rallying to your banners, ready to attack the enemies of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai50;Let us hunt together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai51;A host of spirits, led by old tree men appears from the forest, rallying to your banners, ready to attack the enemies of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai51;The Weave blesses us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai52;The summer has passed, and the spirits of your army start to fall to the torpor of winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai53;No cell will hold you as long as the great forces of Athel Loren are with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai53;The spirits freed me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasrai53005;Trying to hold the Avatar of Isha herself while inside Athel Loren was folly: the goddess has freed herself with the help of a legion of angered forest spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasrai53005;Trying to hold the Avatar of Kurnous himself while inside Athel Loren was folly: the god has broken out of your boundaries with a horde of angry spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCasrai53005;Athel Loren is deeply connected with the forest spirits. The one you tried to hold slipped away, welcomed by the very ground of its homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasrai53005;Damnations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasrai54;Spirits attack the supply lines, soldiers are driven insane or just disappear into the wilds. It is clear your troops are not welcomed in the alien glades of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspellsinger1;The Weave allowed an old spellsinger to wander into your glade. The traveller has little memory of what brought them here, but they are ready to put themselves unto your service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger1;It's a sign. They are welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger1;It might be cursed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.2;All the children of Asuryan are connected to the Weave, but you've always felt a special link to the forest. Maybe your guardian could teach you to sharpen your senses and learn proper magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.2;I'll be a wise Spellsinger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.3;For some time your [GetFromRelation] has bothered you, asking if you could teach [From.GetHerHim] how to link with the Weave and cast spells.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.3;You could have some potential...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.3;Get lost. This is not a game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.4;You've spent years on books of ancient lore, meditating in the depths of the forest, searching for a vision from the spirits, but to no avail. Your results in magic study has been less than mediocre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.4;No point continuing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.7;My [GetFromRelation] refused to teach you magic, claiming you've not the prerequisites to handle such a dangerous power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.7;I could! How could you say that?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.8;All in Athel Loren is about balance, summer and winter, death and rebirth, light and darkness. The endless cycles of the great seasons determine the existence of all beings. The Asrai understand the delicate nature of the Weave and do not shun from embracing all of its forms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.8;I will follow the lightened path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.8;I will follow the dark path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAspellsinger.8005;The more time passes, the more it appears clear your student has decided to shun darkness and embrace the path of the Lightweaver, to heal the sickness and corruption that may tarnish the forest and preserve its pureness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBspellsinger.8005;The more time passes, the more it appears clear your student has decided to shun light and embrace the path of the Darkweaver, to twist and instil terror upon those who would do harm to Athel Loren and threaten it's immaculate purity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.8005;I'm proud of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.8005;That's... Still acceptable, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.16;Your guardian has decided to take you as an apprentice and teach you in the ways of the Weave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.16;I'll soon be a powerful Spellsinger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.17;Spellsingers are the powerful magic-users of the Asrai. They tap into the Weave of Athel Loren and through this bond they can reshape the forest around them. After your long studies, you've been acknowledged as a learned mage of the Asrai people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOTAspellsinger.17;The forest speaks to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.19;You've taught much of what you know to your [GetFromRelation] in the past few years and now you wonder if [From.GetSheHe] is ready to be recognized as a full mage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.19;The time has come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger.19;Not really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.20;Your [GetFromRelation] has finally acknowledged, after many years of study, that [From.GetSheHe] is proud to call you a Spellsinger, no longer a mere apprentice of the arcane arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.20;Yet there's still so much to learn...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.21;There are many things that a mage-to-be should know to protect himself from the dangers of sorcery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger21;A Spellsinger should discern light from darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger21;A Spellsinger should always strive for perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspellsinger21;A Spellsinger should never lose his calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDspellsinger21;Let's just focus on magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.22;In the past weeks you've spent several hours discussing with your [GetFromRelation] about how a Spellsinger should keep his mind clear and judge reality in an impartial way, so as to not be deceived by the corruption of Chaos or the lies of inferior beings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger22;Of course, it's objective we are the enlightened kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.23;In the past weeks you've spent several hours discussing with your [GetFromRelation] about how a Spellsinger should always work at his best to perfect his art, study new spells, assure himself of correct ritual and so on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger23;I wouldn't want to blow up anything. By mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.24;In the past weeks you've spent several hours discussing with your [GetFromRelation] about how a Spellsinger should always keep his calm, lest his passion might cloud his senses and twist his spells against him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger24;But isn't passion that gives purpose to the Hunt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.100;You've lingered in the darkness for so long, its taint has started to obfuscate your senses, filling you with irrational hate and impure thoughts. Balance must be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger100;Light to compensate Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspellsinger100;I shall endure nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.101;Your [GetFromRelation] is plagued by [From.GetHerHis] tidings to the dark powers. As a Lightweaver it is your duty to restore the balance of [From.GetHerHis] soul so that [From.GetSheHe] can continue to serve the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger101;I will prepare the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.102;The ritual of [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to tame your troubled soul. Once again the dark powers are entrapped and tied by your will, ready to be unleashed only against the enemies of Athel Loren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.102;And soon they will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspellsinger.103;Despite [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s best efforts, you're still plagued by bloodied visions and twisted dreams. The dark powers you've always called upon to flay your enemies are now consuming your very soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspellsinger.103;I *will* contain them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAaicleanup010;Your spell has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTHIGHELF.0.b;I could have done just as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.0;While on a border patrol, one of your courtiers defeated a band of raiders, almost single-handedly driving them off. [From.GetSheHeCap] is hailed as a great warrior by all in the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.1;While on a border patrol, a courtier's small force was ambushed, but [From.GetSheHe] fled and left [From.GetHerHis] men to die! [From.GetHerHisCap] name is in disgrace, and [From.GetSheHe] has shamed our entire court with [From.GetHerHis] cowardice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.2.a;It reminds me of the first light of a winter moon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.2.b;It reminds me of the first light of a winter moon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.2;This courtier has composed a stunning new epic, which brings tears to the eyes of anyone who hears it. At the feast table, even hardened warriors are seen with misty eyes, reminiscing of the glories of your ancient race.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.3.b;No, I think I'll sit this one out.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.3;Foul creatures such as manticores and hydras sometimes make their way down from the Anulii mountains. Your huntmaster is arranging a great hunt, do you wish to join in it and perhaps win a new trophy for the walls of your feast hall?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTHIGHELF.4.a;Who am I to go against tradition?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHIGHELF.4;While the Phoenix King is the political centre of Ulthuan, the Everqueen is its spiritual heart. It is tradition that they have a year-long ritual marriage and produce a daughter who shall be the next Everqueen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCHIGHELF.6;You travel swiftly to Avelorn, where you spend many days and nights with the Everqueen. She assures you that her magic will guarantee that a child will be born shortly - the new future Everqueen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCasur1;The priestesses make sure you are ready by casting the proper protective spells, and you leap into the flames that will consecrate you as the rightful ruler of Ulthuan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur1;May Asuryan judge me well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur2;You emerge unscathed from the holy flames, the priestesses raise their praises to the Gods and the new Phoenix King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur2;Asuryan blesses me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur3;You enter the flames with a steady heart, but the Gods do not favour you today. Asuryan's gaze passes through your protective spells and your flesh is scourged with fire. The priestesses manage to recover you, shrieking and maimed, but the will of the Gods has been made clear today, you are not the rightful heir to the Phoenix Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur3;AAAARGH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur4;You enter the flames with a steady heart, but the Gods do not favour you today. Asuryan's gaze passes through your protective spells and your flesh is scourged with fire. The priestesses struggle to save you, but your offences must have been great indeed, for they recover nothing but a blackened carcass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur4;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur5;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has passed through the Flames of Asuryan without being burned, thus proving his divinely-given right to rule over Ulthuan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur5;Long live the Phoenix King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBasur5;What a weird custom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur6;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to pass through the Flames of Asuryan, but the god saw his wickedness and burned him, sculpting a blasphemous shape around a blasphemous heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur6;He cannot wear the crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBasur6;He was burned for crossing a fire. So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur7;Your [GetFromRelation] was burned by the holy Flames of Asuryan, disgracing his whole line along with himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur7;But I'm not tainted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur8;The healing spells are slowly putting you back to health, but the scourge of Asuryan remains, marking your skin, weighing on your troubled soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur8;How could this happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur9;[From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to pass through the Flames of Asuryan, but the God saw his wickedness and burned him, leaving nothing but a blackened carcass in his wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur9;A false king has been revealed by the righteous gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBasur9;Why did he even cross the fire in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur10;Your [GetFromRelation] was burned by the holy Flames of Asuryan, dying a horrible death and disgracing his whole bloodline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur10;But I'm not tainted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur11;You've been chosen by the Dragon Princes to take the lead of Ulthuan, following the disgraceful reign of [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur11;I will rule in the grace of Asuryan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur12;Following in the footsteps of the blasphemous Witch-King, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has renounced Asuryan to follow Kaela Mensha Khaine, planting the seeds for a potential second Sundering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAasur12;He is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBasur12;Shame befalls him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur11001;The Dragon Princes have decided that it is in the best interest of Ulthuan that its rule pass to [From.GetFirstName] after the ignominious departure of the last Phoenix King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCasur13;Some Elves believe the Asur should detach themselves from the corruption of the outside world, others that it is their duty to lead lesser species away from evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur13;We need to protect Ulthuan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur13;We need to protect the World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur14;I am afraid the Faction I represent must insist on changing the current political stance of Ulthuan regarding the outside world.

EVTOPTAasur14;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur14;This is not what I command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur15;Your shameful attempt at blackmail has not succeeded. No matter how many corrupted souls you have enticed to help carry out your plan I will not give in without a fight. Ulthuan has been secluded for far too long!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur15;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur16;I see the error of my ways and understand now what is best for the Asur. I will issue a formal declaration disallowing further interaction with the outside world.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasur21;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur21;This is not what I command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur22;Your shameful attempt at blackmail has not succeeded. No matter how many corrupted souls you have enticed to help carry out your plan I will not give in without a fight. Ulthuan needs not to meddle in the affairs of shortlived barbarians!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasur24;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur25;[From.GetTitledName] has agreed to the demands of the Interventionist Party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur25;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur19;Ulthuan no longer recognizes the pleas of the outside world, giving paramount importance to the prosperity of the Asur over all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur19;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur20;Ulthuan recognizes its role as the sole protector of the whole world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur20;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur26;Now that the land has been freed from uncivilized indigenous barbarians, it can be assigned to a proper well-bred elven legate who will oversee its colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur26;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur29;The appointed ruler of your newly acquired land abroad has sent word that [From.GetSheHe] needs funds to start the project of colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur29;I will pay for it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur29;All the Princes of Ulthuan should contribute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasur29;We cannot spare the resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur30;As is customary, the Phoenix King has sent troops and resources to help start up the colonization process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur30;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur31;The Phoenix King has issued a special tax to fund the effort of Asur colonization abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur31;I'll gladly pay it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur31;Unspeakable waste!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur32;Sadly, Ulthuan cannot spare resources to forward to your colony right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur32;Did they abandon us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur33;One of your colonies has reported a great victory for the Asur. As customary, they've sent a tribute containing a share of their spoils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur33;I'll take them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasur33;All the Princes of Ulthuan who supported them should take a share.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTDasur39;Ulthuan will join our brethren and fight alongside them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasur41;One of Ulthuan's colonies is entangled in a war with an uncivilized race. The Phoenix King has issued a special tax to help it in its struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCasur43;One of Ulthuan's colonies is entangled in a war with an uncivilized race. The Phoenix King has declared to mobilize the entire Kingdom to help them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasur47;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur48;Sadly, Ulthuan does not feel the world is worth saving, despite your efforts to convince them otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasur48;What about my boatload of treasure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasur50;Gaen Vale, the most sacred place for the Asur, the core of Ulthuan and the centre of the Vortex which keeps the Chaos from pouring in and unravel the World is under attack. Would you stand with the Everqueen and defend the very heart of your homeland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet, as the discussion goes on, you start to see how [From.GetSheHe] is hinting more and more to something far from pleasant.\n For how many kind words [From.GetSheHe] said to you, [From.GetSheHe] said twice as many against your spouse, statingg [From.GetSheHe] is worry of your future in such a grim relationship and that you might find a greater happiness elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16;You make very good points…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate16;How much is my happiness worth to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate16;If I concede to this, will you help me later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasurdebate16;This is outrageous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16001;Your argument was such, that [From.GetFirstName] was completely swayed by it and decided to publically denounce [From.GetHerHis] spouse in front of all the guests. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16001;Good, Good…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16011;The points made by [From.GetFirstName] were certainly valid. Denouncing publicly your spouse might have gained you some bad reputation, but you're certain it will all soon passed as other realize the righteousness of your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16011;They surely will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16021;What a disgrace. Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to publicly denounce and forsake you as a spouse. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] was wayed by the poisonous words coming from the slithering tongue of [FromFrom.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16021;Cursed them both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate16002;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to openly meddle with someone's private life openly would preposterous. Sadly, while [From.GetFirstName] seems to have understood what you suggest, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem to be willing to follow your suggestion without taking some compensation as well.\n You might be able to reach an agreement with [From.GetHerHim], provided you gift a certain sum into [From.GetHerHis] reserve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16002;All that you need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate16002;I cannot do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16012;The points made by [From.GetFirstName] were certainly valid and even moreso were [From.GetHerHis] coins. Denouncing publicly your spouse might have gained you some bad reputation, but you're certain it will all soon passed as other realize the righteousness of your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16012;They surely will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16022;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to recognize the weight of the trust you were ready to give [From.GetHerHim] in this delicate and very much private matter. You have therefore no other choice but to deny [From.GetHerHis] outrageous claims as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16022;It was nonsense anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate16003;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to openly meddle with someone's private life openly would preposterous. Sadly, while [From.GetFirstName] seems to have understood what you suggest, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem to be willing to follow your suggestion without taking some compensation as well.\n You might be able to reach an agreement with [From.GetHerHim], provided you give your word to support [From.GetHerHim] in the future on a matter of [From.GetHerHis] chosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasurdebate16003;You've done your best to expose your case as gently and as obscurely as possible: to openly meddle with someone's private life openly would preposterous.

EVTOPTAasurdebate16003;Very well, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate16003;I cannot allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16013;The points made by [From.GetFirstName] were certainly valid and even moreso were [From.GetHerHis] promise of future support in the political matters. Denouncing publicly your spouse might have gained you some bad reputation, but you're certain it will all soon passed as other realize the righteousness of your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate16023;It was nonsense anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16004;You could understand if [From.GetFirstName] raised some doubts on your claims regarding [From.GetHerHis] spouse, but to attack you so abruptly? What an ungrateful thing to do. After all, you spoke of this delicate matter only for [From.GetHerHis] own good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16004;Truly shameful…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate16014;Unfortunately you had to be direct to convince [From.GetFirstName] of your refusal. This impoliteness to your host will certainly affect your reputation, but you are firmly sure it is the lesser evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate16014;It certainly is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate17;[From.GetFirstName] talks with you for quite a long time and does not shy away from showering you with kind and elaborate words to weave your virtues. Yet, as the discussion goes on, you start to see how [From.GetSheHe] is hinting more and more to something more than simple pleasantries.\n It would appear your host is interest in formally proposing to you, as [From.GetSheHe] says, for the betterment of both yourselves and of your subjects, who will certainly rejoice to such an alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17;You make a compelling case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate17;How much is this betterment worth to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCasurdebate17;If I concede to this, will I count on you later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDasurdebate17;I'm afraid this is not agreeable to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17001;It is truly wonderful for you to hear that [From.GetFirstName] fully shares your expectations and desires. You are quick to lead [From.GetHerHim] with you at the centre of the gazebo and stop the musician with a kind gesture, to call everyone's attention and formally propose to [From.GetHerHim]. \n You had already called a priestess for such a possibility and lose no time in asking her to perform the rite right there and then, so that you and [From.GetFirstName] may be joined forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17001;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAasurdebate17011;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate17002;You've done your best to make your proposal as reasonably and passionately as it could possibly be balanced, yet it doesn't seem to be enough for [From.GetFirstName]. As a proof of your love and commitment, [From.GetSheHe] asks for tangible action and a dowry of some sort.\n You might be able to reach an agreement with [From.GetHerHim], provided you give a sufficient sum of money, taken from your personal estate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17002;Hm, very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate17002;This is too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17012;Once [From.GetFirstName] has provided [From.GetHerHis] part, you have no problem accepting [From.GetHerHis] proposal.

EVTOPTAasurdebate17012;O joyous day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17022;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to truly show [From.GetHerHis] love to you in a tangible way, providing an acceptable dowry for your wedding. At this point you have no other choice but to refuse this foolish proposal entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17022;How unfortunate we could not reach an agreement…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate17003;You've done your best to make your proposal as reasonably and passionately as it could possibly be balanced, yet it doesn't seem to be enough for [From.GetFirstName].

EVTOPTAasurdebate17003;Very well, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate17003;I cannot allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17013;[From.GetFirstName]'s court was certainly charming, even moreso were [From.GetHerHis] promise of future support in the political matters.

EVTDESCasurdebate17023;It seems [From.GetFirstName] is not willing to truly show [From.GetHerHis] love to you in a tangible way, providing presenting [From.GetHerHim]self as supportive in all matters to [From.GetHerHis] spouse-to-be. At this point you have no other choice but to refuse this foolish proposal entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17023;It was nonsense anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17004;You could understand if [From.GetFirstName] resisted to your courtship, but to attack you so abruptly? What a brutish thing to do. After all, what were you doing, if not celebrating [From.GetHerHis] beauty and virtue and what a fortunate union the one between you too would have been?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17004;Maybe [From.GetSheHe]'ll change [From.GetHerHis] mind in a few centuries…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate17014;Unfortunately you had to be direct to convince [From.GetFirstName] of your refusal. This impoliteness to your host will certainly affect your reputation, but you are firmly sure it is the lesser evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate17014;It certainly is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate18;The treacherous snake. [From.GetFirstName] has not invited you with any kind thoughts in [From.GetHerHis] mind: this was nothing but a trap, a conceited attempt to publically shame you out of some preposterous claims.\n The host points at you, raising [From.GetHerHis] voice in [From.GetHerHis] pontification to catch as much attention as possible, but still without shouting nor veering from polite and sanctimonious reproace to gross vulgarity.\n To prevent disaster, you must fight at [From.GetHerHis] own game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate18;I shan't stand for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate18001;The filth in [From.GetHerHis] tongue spurs from the filth in [From.GetHerHis] soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate18002;Time and again, you expose the lackings of your opponent, weaving [From.GetHerHis] failures upon [From.GetHerHim] as a coat, for everyone to gaze upon them.\n Time and again, your opponent fights back, contesting your claims and making some of [From.GetHerHis] own. The discussion goes on for hours, as the public continues to enjoy the music and the wine, with its ears always focused on you.\n Then, finally, brought to exasperation by [From.GetFirstName]'s claims, you cannot refrain from directly swearing at [From.GetHerHim]. As [From.GetSheHe] smirks with satisfaction, you both realize [From.GetSheHe] has won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBasurdebate18002;Time and again, you defend against the preposterous accuses of your opponent, shaming [From.GetHerHis] conduct as a host and counterattacking with some insinuations of your own.\n Time and again, your opponent starts anew, skillfully defending against your quips. The discussion goes on for hours, as the public continues to enjoy the music and the wine, with its ears always focused on you.\n Then, finally, brought to exasperation by [From.GetFirstName]'s claims, you cannot refrain from directly swearing at [From.GetHerHim]. As [From.GetSheHe] smirks with satisfaction, you both realize [From.GetSheHe] has won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate18002;Hmpfh, you worthless..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAasurdebate19;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been spending a lot of time celebrating you and your dynasty. For days now [From.GetSheHe] has talked to friends and acquaintaces about your great deeds and complimented your virtues with you in person.\n As [From.GetSheHe] goes on, [From.GetSheHe] doesn't shy away from trying to force out of you your opinion on some political issue [From.GetSheHe] seems to care very much about. At this point it would be incredibly rude to disagree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19;And I will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBasurdebate19;But still I must.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate19001;[From.GetFirstName] could do nothing besides granting [From.GetHerHis] support after all you've said and done to stroke [From.GetHerHis] ego. It might have been somewhat debasing to spend so much time singing praises of someone else, but it served its purpose in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19001;It is an exercise in dialectic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCasurdebate19002;[From.GetFirstName] did not seem to get the tone of your music. Such a waste of time and reputation will come to nothing. You've spent days praising [From.GetHerHim] amongst friends and acquaintances, yet [From.GetSheHe] still refuses to return your kindness with a hand of friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAasurdebate19002;It is an exercise in dialectic at the very least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# DIVORCE
#
EVTDESCsdivorce1;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to divorce you. As the offended party, you can choose to demand compensation in the form of gold or land, if [From.GetSheHe] has any. If [From.GetFirstName] has not enough silver to pay you for, [From.GetFirstName] will receive a serious hit to [From.GetHerHis] reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce1;I don't really care, [From.GetSheHe] can go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce1;I'll demand monetary compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsdivorce1;I'll demand land from [From.GetHerHis] demesne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce2;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to allow the divorce proceedings to be completed without asking anything more than your part of the costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce2;It was good while it lasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset by your decision to divorce. If you wish for [From.GetHerHis] cohoperation, [From.GetSheHe] has set up a punitive compensation for [From.GetHerHis] broken feelings and loss of status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce3;I don't have that kind of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3001;[From.GetFirstName] has capitulated to your request. After everything has been signed, you're ready to say goodbye to [From.GetHerHim] forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3001;And good riddance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3002;[From.GetFirstName] has refused to give in to your demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3002;Just go away then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce3002;Then guess what? No divorce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce3003;[From.GetFirstName] did not take well at all your refuse and has decided to retort annulling completely the divorce proceedings. It seems you'll still be married for some time after all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce3003;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsdivorce4;[From.GetFirstName] was very upset by your decision to divorce. If you wish for [From.GetHerHis] cohoperation, [From.GetSheHe] has asked for you to give up to some of your demesne as a reparation for the damage caused by your hearthless soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsdivorce4;As long as [From.GetSheHe] goes away…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsdivorce4;I won't do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# MARRIAGE

EVTDESCAselfmarriage1001;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage1001;It seems [From.GetFirstName] has married another elf. Any other attempt at courship can certainly no longer taken in broad daylight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTZselfmarriage1001;This was a waste of time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1001;I'l just ask [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1001;A generous show of wealth will prove my commitment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1001;A generous show of power will prove my commitment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1001;There must be some other way…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage1003;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1003;I shall court [From.GetHerHim] with passion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCselfmarriage1005;You've taken up the task of courting [From.GetFirstName], hopefully one day managing to take [From.GetHerHis] hand in marriage. How should you proceed next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage1005;I shall hunt rare games for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage1005;I shall gift [From.GetHerHim] the most precious items of my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCselfmarriage1005;I will show [From.GetHerHim] exquisite pleasures such as [From.GetSheHe] has never seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDselfmarriage1005;I shall give [From.GetHerHim] access to my vast library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2;[From.GetFirstName] has spent the past months drowning you in presents and gifts of all sorts, hoping to receive attention from you. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2;I do like presents…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage2;What a waste of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2001;You spent a lot on [From.GetFirstName] but it certainly seems [From.GetSheHe] appreciated many of your gifts. Showing to be a dependable partner is certainly fundamental to put the basis of a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2001;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage2002;Despite your efforts and expenses [From.GetFirstName] has not looked interested in any way to any of the presents you've riddled [From.GetHerHis] home in the past weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage2002;Hmpf…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3;[From.GetFirstName] has tried many times in the past weeks to show off [From.GetHerHis] influence and power. You've had many acquaintances talk of [From.GetHerHim] in a throughly positive light and telling you what a wonderful spouse [From.GetSheHe]'d make.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3;That is true…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage3;Not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3001;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] has worked flawlessly: you had to call in several favors and subtly have your friends work their ways into [From.GetHerHis] circle of acquaintances to tell [From.GetHerHim] what a wonderful partner you'd make, but it was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3001;Yes, it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage3002;Your attempt at impressing [From.GetFirstName] seems to have fallen flat: despite all the favors you had to call in from friends and relatives, nobody was able to convince [From.GetHerHim] of your good intentions and noble birth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage3002;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another poem. You've lost count by now of how many sweet words [From.GetSheHe] has written for you in delicate and moving style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4;That is sweet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage4;How tedious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4001;You've spent weeks writing rhymes to [From.GetFirstName], and [From.GetSheHe] finally has started to mellow down on you. It was a lot of work, but you seem to have caught [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage4002;All the sleepless nights spend writing poems to the sweet [From.GetFirstName] appear to have been for naught: [From.GetSheHe] remains cold to your delicate verses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage4002;Hm…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5;From shows of light and illusions to work of art impossible to create for the most skilled craftsman, [From.GetFirstName] has given you quite a show of [From.GetHerHis] magical powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5;I'm impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage5;That's somewhat irresponsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5001;[From.GetFirstName] has certainly been impressed by the spells and incantations you worked on for [From.GetHerHim], weaving wind after wind to catch [From.GetHerHis] attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5001;Outstanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage5002;Not even the Winds of Magic seem to catch [From.GetFirstName]'s attention. Your many attempts at impress [From.GetHerHim] with your magic have come to nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage5002;How can one not appreciate the Art!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6;[From.GetFirstName] has been cornering you at every occasion, whispering sweet nothings in your ear and leading you in the most compromising places. You've resisted [From.GetHerHis] advances until now, but is it really worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6;Let's do this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage6;Maybe later on…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6001;[From.GetFirstName] couldn't have resisted for much longer. You've used all your skills in the past weeks to charm and seduce [From.GetHerHim] and your effort has finally given its fruits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6001;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage6002;You've used all the tricks you had, but [From.GetFirstName] appears immune to your charms. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe]'s not really interested in the physical aspect of the future relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage6002;What else then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7;[From.GetFirstName] has sent you another exotic fur, fashioned after [From.GetHerHis] last kill. This suitor has spent the last week overflowing your home with trophies of [From.GetHerHis] hunts, all made in your honor, according to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7;It's beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage7;So many wasted lives…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7001;[From.GetFirstName] has been captivated by the trophies you've sent [From.GetHerHim] in the past days, result of your hard work in the wilderness. In fact, you've heard from multiple sources of [From.GetHerHim] wearing some of your furs in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7001;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage7002;[From.GetFirstName] has not even pretended to accept your last trophy, sending the fur back with a polite request to stop your endeavours in the wilderness. It seems like this is not something [From.GetSheHe]'s interested in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage7002;I see…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8;Another ravishing bouquet has been sent by [From.GetFirstName]. There have been several in the past days, accompanied by invitations to [From.GetHerHis] villa as well. You're wondering if it would be proper to accept at this point…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8;It does look enchanted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage8;I have no time for this frivolousness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8001;[From.GetFirstName] has finally accepted your invitation to visit your gardens at the villa. You guide [From.GetHerHim] across the colorful landscape and soon captivate [From.GetHerHim] with the wonders you've grown within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage8002;[From.GetFirstName] continues to ignore your floreal presents and the invitations to the villa. According to [From.GetHerHim] it is not a good period, but it might be that [From.GetSheHe] just doesn't like your flowers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage8002;I should try something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9;More than once in the past weeks [From.GetFirstName] has managed to drag you into some obscene, wild party which has left you sickly and confused at every morning. At first it looked unbearable, but now you've starting to see how this kind of entertainment could be something of an acquired taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9;See you again tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage9;Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9001;You've managed to sneak [From.GetFirstName] into more than one wild party in the last few weeks. At first [From.GetSheHe] didn't seem to appreciate your companionship, but [From.GetSheHe] has since then started to like celebrating excess alongside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9001;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage9002;You've attempted to sway [From.GetFirstName] with wild feasts and intoxicating philters, but [From.GetSheHe] doesn't seem interested in your kind of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage9002;Drats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10;[From.GetFirstName] is certainly meek for a suitor, if [From.GetSheHe] is a suitor at all. In the past week, [From.GetSheHe] has only been interested in spending time reading with you and talking about the ancient legends of your race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10;It is all so interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage10;What a bore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10001;You've spent days with [From.GetFirstName], nosedived in old tomes and ancient scrolls, studying the history of your great heritage. There is so much you seem to have in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10001;Did you read this one yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage10002;Your attempts at showing some ancient elven scrolls to [From.GetFirstName] have failed, no differently from many other similar gifts. It might be [From.GetSheHe] isn't very interested in ancient elven literature…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage10002;How can that be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCselfmarriage11112;Before you make your proposal official, you should decide what kind of union are you hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBselfmarriage11112;A Matrilineal Marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a matrilineal union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of matrilineal marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage11;Even though you barely had time to truly know each other, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to propose [From.GetHerHim]self to you officially, hoping for a regular union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage11;You've been courted by [From.GetFirstName] for some time, hence [From.GetHerHis] proposal of regular marriage does not really come as a surprise to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11;Before answering, I must consult my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage11;I could never disobey my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage11001;[From.GetFirstName] was ready to accept your proposal. Not that there was ever any doubt about it: a courtier can hardly oppose the decision of [From.GetHerHis] rightful liege. A great ceremony will soon be held and the priestesses shall bind you in marriage, formalizing your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage11001;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this matrilineal marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in matrilineal marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage12;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] has come to you to inform you that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has formally proposed to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] and, as you are [FromFrom.GetHerHis] legal guardian, is coming to ask your permission to make this regular marriage official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDselfmarriage12;Your suitor, [From.GetFirstName], has decided to propose formally to you, asking your hand in regular marriage. The time has come to decide whether you want to spend the rest of your long life with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAselfmarriage12;I accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12;I cannot allow it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12001;You are heartened to hear [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s answer to your proposal. A great ceremony will soon held to bind you and your newfound soulmate in marriage and formalize your union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12001;I'm so happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage12002;Sadly, [From.GetFirstName] doesn't seem to share your feelings for [From.GetHerHim] and has refused your proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage12002;How could you?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13;Many elves come to partecipate at your wedding ceremony, congratulating both with you and your spouse, discussing politics and listening to the soave music in the air. The priests of many gods have come to celebrate your union, bestowing bestowing blessings of fertility from Isha on the bride, auguries of fortune from Lileath, advices of steady conduct to please Asuryan, promises of riches from Vaul and predictions of long life from Morai-heg. Offerings are brought to each of the shrines as you walk by them and receive the gods' blessings, binding you each time further together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13;And so we shall be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13001;The promise of life can only be bought by the certainty of death.\n You and your spouse raise the beating heart of the sacrifice to the shrine of Khaine and let it burn under the unforgiving gaze of the Lord of Murder, in the hopes it'll placate his thirst and allow your union to bear fruit. Only a few selected guests are honored with an invitation, dutifully kept afar and secretly watched by crossbowmen, ready to act at the first suspicious movement. Once the first ceremony is finally over, you leave the temple with your spouse, ready to make an ever more gruesome and enticing ritual to satisfy Atharti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13001;The gods watch us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAselfmarriage13002;There is a time for everything. As you reach the spring of this cycle, you are united with your spouse, but, as all Asrai know, this time will someday pass and you shall be separated. In your marriage, you embody, in a small part, the sacred union of Isha and Kurnous and, like them and like all things, your happiness now will find balance in future sorrow. This is what the forest spirit remembers you as it gives its blessing and binds you together. Yet, as all cycles pass, you shall accept the nature of things with a light heart and do the best of what you have right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBselfmarriage13002;We will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCselfmarriage1001;Since you're married already, it would not be appropriate to continue courting [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTXselfmarriage1001;It was fun while it lasted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAbeastmen37;I will plead for it at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbeastmen38;The land of [From.Location.GetName] is scourged by a massive Beastmen infestation. Your subjects have pleaded many times for you to fund an expedition to cleanse them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbeastmen38;Sounds reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbeastmen38;We cannot spare anything for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbeastmen39;Your soldiers did their job and exterminated every last one of the Beastmen still scourging your land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbeastmen39;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbeastmen40;The expedition had catastrophic results: not only the Beastmen repelled your forces, the battle has sent them into a frenzy, if they gain further momentum, they might turn into a full horde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbeastmen40;We must prepare ourselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBbeastmen42;The Ruinous Powers have touched you holding and their presence has been made apparent on your newborn [GetFromRelation]. The infant has come to life deformed, screeching from a beast's mouth. Many in your court demand for the creature to be burned immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCbeastmen60005;The little beast in your care grows angrier each day, [From.GetSheHe] is developing a true bloodlust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAbeastmen61005;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbeastmen62;You despise being so weak and small, with no horns nor strength. You crave for the day you will be able to carve your place as rightful leader of a great herd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbeastmen62;Grrrrhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbeastmen62005;The little beast in your care is restless, violently trying to carve its place amongst the other children of [From.GetHerHis] age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbeastmen62005;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbeastmen63;Your natural inclination for violence has lately assumed a new flavour when you find yourself close to young people of the opposite gender, especially if they're beastmen like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbeastmen63;Grrrrhh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbeastmen63005;The little beast in your care has developed an insatiable lust, abusing other children whenever [From.GetSheHe] manages to subdue them or, if nothing else is available, spending hours humping trees and rocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# BRETONNIAN
#
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.0;You are the ruler of a Bretonnian castle, and you - like the rest of your fellow rulers - are an ordained Knight of the Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.1;You are a skilled warrior, and it is time you took up your duties to the realm and became a Knight Errant of Bretonnia. It is your duty to seek out dangerous threats and conquer them in the name of the Lady.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.2;You are a knight of Bretonnia, it is only fitting that you travel the land doing great deeds, rescuing maidens and slaying monsters. Will you take up the questing life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.20.a;I return home to heal - For the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.20;You have become wounded, and can no longer carry on the questing life. It is time to return to your castle and regain your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.21;You are a knight of Bretonnia, but only the most noble and pure knights are worthy to sip from the Holy Grail of the Lady of the Lake. Do you want to test yourself on this great - but also dangerous, quest?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.22.b;Simple peasants - so that's where my tax money went!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.22;You come across a remote shrine, dedicated to a sighting of the Lady many years ago. Naturally you leave an offering to help maintain the shrine, but as you prepare to leave a local headman boldly asks you for a further donation to the help feed the local village.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.24.a;Away with that, temptress! Just water for me from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.24.b;I could indulge myself just once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.24;You are not the purest or most abstinent of knights, so life is a daily challenge to meet the lofty ideals you hold. One night you and your retinue arrive in a decent tavern to rest after your latest efforts, and soon after you take a seat a barmaid arrives to serve. Tired and deprived, you feel especially appreciative at the sight of the pitcher of wine balanced on her hip, and her warm inviting smile...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.25.a;*restrain yourself* Be on your way, peasant...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.25.b;I'll horsewhip you from here to Cathay, you foul peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.25;While passing through the countryside, you proceed past a filthy family of mud-scrabbling peasants. They drop their loads and fall to the ground with eyes averted as you pass by, but you can hardly believe it when one particularly malodorous one looks you directly in the eye!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.26.a;Well met, Sir Knight! I am ready for the challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.26;You can't believe it... one day while riding in the woods, the Green Knight appears. This is the final test! If you prove worthy and defeat him, the Lady of the Lake will appear and allow you to sip from the Holy Grail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.27;It... it's finally happening! The Lady of the Lake appears before you, her grace and beauty beyond compare. Purified from your trials she allows you to sip from the Grail, and you feel vitality and strength flow into you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.3;You have become maimed, and can no longer carry on the questing life. It is time to return to your castle, and focus on strengthening your own lands with the rest of your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.30.c;I care nothing for what my vassals think!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.31.a;Yes, I rule with the Lady's Blessing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia31B;No, but I will continue questing for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.31.c;I care nothing for what my vassals think!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.31;Seven years have passed - have you become a Grail Knight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.32;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has succeeded in the Grail Quest, and now rules with the blessing of the Lady of the Lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.33;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has failed in his Grail Quest, but has decided to rule on without the blessing of the Lady of the Lake. This is almost certain to start a civil war in that realm...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.34;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia is having difficulty completing his grail quest, but is still determined to quest on until he succeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.6.b;No, I seek greater glories than mere trolls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.6;While searching for local challenges, you come across an unusual story. Sheep and peasants have gone missing, and despite repeated punishments the shepherds insist they are not lacking in their duties. They claim a foul beast, as tall as a house and reeking like a tannery lurks in the hills, periodically emerging to devour whatever it can catch. After some conference with your retainers you determine it could very well be a troll! Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35desc;It... it's finally happening! The Lady of the Lake appears before you, her grace and beauty beyond compare. She let's you sip from the grail, but it is not the invigorating and life changing experience you had heard it would be. But, surely you feel... something?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35A;I... I think I feel a little more holy now?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35B;It was the true holy grail, it must have been!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia35C;No, this isn't right. I must continue questing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia36desc;There have been some doubts cast on your vision of the Lady and the Holy Grail. You do not have the aura that other grail knights have, nor did the Green Knight appear to challenge you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia36A;They weren't there - it happened! Maybe the Grail is simply different for each man?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bretonnia37desc;Rumours reach you that the new ruler of Bretonnia has supposedly completed his grail quest, but there are doubts as to whether or not it was the real Grail. This will make his rule a troubled one, no doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DR_bretonnia_son_dies_battle_knight_errant;Several former Knight Errants have recently returned home after completing their questing duties, and they bring news most grave. Your child, [From.GetTitledFirstName], was killed by a group of beastmen during an extremely dangerous mission in southern Bretonnia. They assure you that [From.GetSheHe] faced the foul beasts with bravery and tried [From.GetHerHis] best before [From.GetSheHe] was killed by their overwhelming number.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_dies_battle_knight_errant_opt;My son... he died a hero...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_ambitious_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from his quest as Knight Errant as a changed being. [From.GetSheHe] is more ambitious and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent as a Knight Errant did [From.GetHerHim] good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_ambitious_knight_errant_opt;Did you bring any riches home with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_drunk_knight_errant;After many years in service, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally finshed his duties as a as Knight Errant and returned home. Your child is a changed being, however. [From.GetSheHe] now spends whole afternoons drinking, and stinks of ale, no longer listening to your fatherly advices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_drunk_knight_errant_opt;I knew something bad was going to happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_better_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally returned home after a long and successful journey as Knight Errant! [From.GetSheHe] learned much from his battles against the enemies of the Lady and Bretonnia, alongside fellow knights!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DR_bretonnia_son_returns_depressed_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from his duties as a Knight Errant, but [From.GetSheHe] refuses to speak of [From.GetHerHis] experiences during them. You know [From.GetSheHe] took part in several battles and killed uncountable bandits, beastmen and orcs, but instead of reveling in the glory of [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments, [From.GetFirstName] is plagued by nightmares and jumps at sudden sounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_depressed_knight_errant_opt;Strange...;Étrange...;Seltsam...;;Extraño...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_experienced_knight_errant;A mysterious knight clad in strange armour approaches your throne, and before [From.GetSheHe] can be contained, the strange warrior relieves your guard of [From.GetHerHis] spear in a swift, fluid motion and tosses it aside. Other guards hurry forward, but you raise your hand to stop them. The stranger is [From.GetTitledFirstName], at last returned from his duties as Knight Errant!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_experienced_knight_errant_opt;[From.GetFirstName]! You've... changed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_lowborn_wife_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come back from his duties as Knight Errant, but [From.GetSheHe] is not alone. [From.GetSheHe] has saved a nobleborn lady during his quests and brought her with him. Though of a lesser noble bloodline, this woman seems to be of a perfect breed, a nice addition to our lineage!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_lowborn_wife_knight_errant_opt;To each [From.GetHerHis] own;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_with_gold_knight_errant;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from his Errantry Tour with a carriage filled with the spoils of [From.GetHerHis] quests! Apparently being a Knight Errant is very profitable business. Your child insists on sharing these riches with you, [From.GetHerHis] loving father.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_with_gold_knight_errant_opt;[From.GetFirstName], you make me proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_wounded_knight_errant;A frail, robed character is led into your throne room, and your guards explain that [From.GetSheHe] just arrived on a carriage. The character would only speak your name over and over again, and so [From.GetSheHe] was brought to you. To your horror, you recognize [From.GetHerHim] at last as [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_returns_wounded_knight_errant_opt;My son, what has happened to you!?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_return_knight_errant;Upon learning of the death of your father, you left your Errantry Tour and departed for home on a carriage filled with gold from your glorious accomplishments. It was a long and perilous journey back, but your feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is your birthright. The throne is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_return_knight_errant_opt;It's a sad moment. But it's good to finally be back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_wants_knight_errant;Your child, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has decided to set out on an Errantry Tour in order to prove [From.GetHerHis] his honour as a true Bretonnian! Although [From.GetSheHe] will no doubt gain both glory and valuable battle experience as a Knight Errant, there will be many dangerous quests that could well cost [From.GetHerHis] life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_wants_knight_errant_accept;Go forth, son, for the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_son_wants_knight_errant_deny;I will not allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DR_bretonnia_become_knight_siege;The camp was attacked last night. It seems the besieged are growing desperate with their tactics. Most of the men were caught by surprise but not you... you were not only ready to fight, but rallied some men around you and excelled during in combat. A deed worthy of a Knight of the Realm!;Le camp a été attaqué la nuit dernière, lors d'une sortie désespérée des assiégés.

As people rush to [From.GetHerHis] aid, it becomes obvious there is nothing that can be done for [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] lifeblood spills onto the dirt.;Au départ vous étiez heureux d'avoir touché, puis vous vous êtes rendu compte que la pointe de votre lance avait rencontré un point faible de l'armure de [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] qui a fini empalé. Alors que tout le monde se précipite pour l'aider, il est devenu clair que rien ne pourra le sauver.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.29;How unfortunate;Quel malheur !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.31;You have been declared the winner, defeating [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] in a fine joust.;Vous avez été déclaré vainqueur, battant [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] lors d'une bonne joute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.31;None can beat me;Personne ne peut me battre.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.32;[From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] has been declared the winner, defeating you and eliminating you from the tourney.;[From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] a été déclaré vainqueur, vous ayant défait et éliminé du tournoi. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.32;There is always next time;La prochaine fois !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.33;[From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] were the next to joust in the lists. After many tilts and broken lances [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was eventually unhorsed, leaving [From.GetTitledFirstName] to be declared the winner.;[From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] et [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] étaient les prochains à se rencontrer dans les lices. Après avoir brisé de nombreuses lances, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] a fini par être démonté et [From.GetTitledFirstName] a été déclaré vainqueur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.33;Well done, a fine joust!;Une belle joute !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.34;After many tilts over several days only two knights remained undefeated. [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] faced eachother in the final joust, and after many tilts of finely executed jousting [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] was unhorsed, leaving [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] to be declared the winner of the tourney.;Après de très nombreuses joutes, seuls deux chevaliers sont restés invaincus. [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] et [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] se sont rencontrés lors de la dernière joute et après de nombreuses et belles charges [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] a été démonté et [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] a été déclaré vainqueur du tournoi.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.34;A worthy champion;Un digne champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtourney.9;I will watch every tilt!;Je vais aller voir toutes les joutes !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtourney.13;Maybe some coin can persuade [From.GetHerHim] to fall?;Peut-être que quelques pièces pourraient le(a) persuader de tomber ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.40;You have been drawn against [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] in the next joust, and [From.GetSheHe] is desperate to win it seems. [From.GetSheHeCap] has offered you a fine purse of coin to throw the tilt and let [From.GetHerHim] win.;Vous avez été désigné pour affronter [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] lors de la prochaine joute et [From.GetSheHe] semble avoir peu d'espoir de gagner. [From.GetSheHeCap] vous a offert une belle bourse pour perdre la joute et le laisser gagner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.40;A fair deal, I shall fall at the first tilt;Une belle affaire, je vais tomebr lors de la première charge. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtourney.40;This is dishonourable bribery!;Quelle ignoble pratique !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.41;When [From.GetSheHe] heard of your bribe, [From.GetTitledFirstName] feigned disgust and reluctance at first, but this was clearly a face saving act. [From.GetSheHeCap] eventually accepted your coin, and will now throw the joust at the first tilt.;Lorsqu'[From.GetSheHe] a entendu parlé de votre offre, [From.GetTitledFirstName] a d'abord feint d'être dégouté et de vouloir refusé, mais il s'agissait clairement d'un jeu pour sauver la face. [From.GetSheHeCap] a fini par accepter votre argent et va perdre la joute lors de la première charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.41;Everyone wins;Tout le monde gagne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.42;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was outraged at your attempted bribe, [From.GetSheHe] called it a slight on [From.GetHerHis] honour and rejected it out of hand. [From.GetSheHeCap] vows to beat you on lists fairly. ;[From.GetTitledFirstName] a été choqué par votre tentative de corruption, [From.GetSheHe] a refusé d'entacher son honneur et à rejeter votre offre. [From.GetSheHeCap] veut désormais vous battre sur la lice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.42;[From.GetSheHeCap] values honour too much;[From.GetSheHeCap] fait bien trop de cas de son honneur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.43;[From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s aim is poor, but you casually shift your body in the way so you catch a mild blow from it. You throw yourself from the horse, adding some theatrics to make it look convincing, and in doing so losing the joust.;Le coup porté par [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] est très faible et mal ajusté mais vous parvenez à vous positionner de façon à le recevoir sur votre pectoral. Vous sautez de cheval tout en ajoutant un peu de comédie pour que le coup paraisse convaincant. Vous avez perdu la joute.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.43;A well earned purse;Une bourse bien gagnée.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.44;You casually aim your lance in [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s general direction, sure of a strike in any case. [From.GetTitledFirstName] duly gets in the way and takes a mild blow, theatrically falling from [From.GetHerHis] horse to make a convincing show of it.;Vous tendez votre lance comme vous le pouvez en direction de [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName], sûr que vous allez le toucher. [From.GetTitledFirstName] parvient à se positionner de façon à prendre le coup puis chute en ajoutant assez de comédié pour que l'affaire pariasse convaincante.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.44;A win is a win;Une victoire est une victoire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.45;Whilst perparing for the tourney a young peasant boy has taken to helping with your horse and armour. You're not quite sure where he came from and how he came to start helping you, but he seems an earnest lad and eager to help. Perhaps he would make a good squire?;Alors que vous vous prépariez pour le tournoi, un jeune paysan vous a proposé de vous aider avec votre armure et votre monture. Vous ne savez pas trop d'où il vient et pourquoi il veut vous aider. Peut-être qu'il pourrait faire un bon écuyer ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.45;Yes, I'll take him on;Oui, je vais le prendre.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtourney.45;I won't have some common urchin helping me, be gone!;Je ne vais pas prendre un gamin du commun comme écuyer, déguerpis !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.46;I've been helping [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] in the tourney as [Root.Guardian.GetHerHis] squire, and at the end of the days jousting me and some other squires found a lot of wine! We shared it with some serving girls and had a great time, but the next morning has come and now I feel terrible.;J'ai aidé [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] au tournoi en qualité d'écuyer. Hier soir, après les joutes, j'ai trouvé, avec d'autres écuyers, plusieurs bouteilles de vin ! Nous l'avons partagé avec quelques servantes et nous avons passé du bon temps. Mais ce matin je me sens très mal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.46;I hope [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] wont be mad;J'espère que [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] ne sera pas en colère.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.47;The days jousting is about to begin, and you realise your squire [From.GetTitledFirstName] is horribly hungover. You learn that [From.GetSheHe] and some other squires found a cask of wine and shared it with some serving girls, and got very drunk. His support as a squire in the lists will surely suffer.;La journée de joute est sur le point de commencer et vous réalisez que votre écuyer [From.GetTitledFirstName] a une terrible gueule de bois. Vous apprenez qu'[From.GetSheHe] a découvert, avec d'autres ecuyers, quelques bouteilles de vin qu'ils ont partagé avec de jeunes servantes. [From.GetSheHeCap] risque d'avoir du mal à vous aider dans les lices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.47;Ha! The young lad is growing up!;Ha ! Ce petit jeune est entrain de grandir !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtourney.47;I shall lecture him about his duty as a squire;Je vais le sermonner sur ses devoirs en tant qu'ecuyer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCtourney.47;Right, he has earned a good beating!;Bien, il a mérité une vonne taloche !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.48;Whilst preparing for the tourney you and your squire have been training hard. You have been instructing him in the art of wielding a lance and riding a horse. There have also been intense sparring sessions, and he has been made to understand what his duties in the lists are.;Lors de la préparation pour le tournoi, vous et votre écuyer vous êtes durement entrainés. Vous lui avez appris à manier la lance et à monter un cheval. Vous l'avez aussi entrainé au combat et il semble avoir compris ce qu'il doit faire dans les lices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.48;He seems ready to assist me in the lists;Il semble prêt à m'aider dans les lices.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtourney.49;Whilst preparing for the tourney, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has found time to fit in training for you. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been instructing you in the proper use of a lance, and has been given you intense sparring sessions. Your duties as a squire in the lists have also been made absolutely clear.;Lors de la préparation pour le tournoi, [From.GetTitledFirstName] a trouvé du temps pour vous entrainer. [From.GetSheHeCap] vous a instruit dans l'art du combat et de la lance. Vos devoirs dans les lices en tant qu'écuyer sont désormais tout à fait clairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtourney.49;I am a good squire!;Je suis un bon écuyer !;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# CHAOS EVENTS
#
EVTDESCCHAOS.0;The Everchosen is the champion of all four Chaos Gods. You can journey to the Altar of Ultimate Darkness in distant Naggaroth to seek the favour of the Chaos Gods. The stronger the Winds of Chaos are, the more likely they are to give you their mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.1.a;I wonder how strong the Winds of Chaos are...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.1;You make your way across the wastes, into the northern limits of Naggaroth, where stories tell of the Altar of Ultimate Darkness. Finally, after many trials, you reach your destination...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.a;Yes, I will march alongside the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.10.b;No, I will never march with that fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.10;An Everchosen has been selected, and a great war is being prepared. Daemons of the Dark Gods march under their banner - surely you yourself should also march to war alongside this new champion?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.2.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.2;The Winds of Chaos are weak at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are unlikely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.a;Yes, I will face their terror even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.3.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.3;The Winds of Chaos are only moderately strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are less likely to grant you their blessing. Do you still wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.4.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.4;The Winds of Chaos are  strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are likely to grant you their blessing. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.5.b;No, perhaps now is not the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.5;The Winds of Chaos are very strong at the moment, and the Ruinous Powers are almost certain to grant you their blessing if you pass their trials. Do you wish to proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.6.a;I will prove myself worthy - charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.6;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, testing your faith to its very core. Your mind is strong enough to persevere, and finally you come to the test... you must defeat the Champion of the Gods to receive their mark!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.7.a;Urrrghh! No... not ... like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.7;Upon entering the temple you are beset by nightmarish visions, and attacked by daemons of all sorts! You cannot hold on, the Gods are displeased at your trespass, and soon you are surrounded fighting desperately for your life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.8;You have won the duel against the champion, and you finally kneel before the Altar of Ultimate Darkness, and receive the mark of the Dark Gods. 'Rise... Everchosen... and conquer in our name' a terrible unison of four voices growls in your head...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHAOS.9.a;Let all bow before the Everchosen!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCHAOS.9;You return to your lands, bearing the mark of the Gods. Across the wastes, word spreads like wildfire: An Everchosen has been selected, and armies of daemons march by [From.GetHerHis] side! They would be fools not to join you now in the coming war...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
EVTDESCschaos107;After enduring the aches and pains of your body for what seems an eternity	The Gods have have decided reward you for perseverance. You even feel more alive than you ever did before!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos106;The Beastmen hate Mankind with a deep loathing born of uncounted centuries of battle and righteous persecution. They seek a return to that primeval age when Man was little more than prey to be hunted and devoured, where the Beastmen were considered the true masters of the world. The lands you've taken must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos1;You could have sworn you had a holding here, but there's nothing left. As you wonder what could have happened, you spot the fortress flying over your head with wings of stone before disappearing in the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17;[From.GetFirstName] is bound and dragged to the centre of the summoning circle while you start chanting the spell. What daemon should you call forth from the Warp to inhabit [From.GetHerHis] body and devour [From.GetHerHis] soul?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos17;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos17;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos17;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but at the last moment you manage to break free of your boundaries and interrupt the ritual. In the backlash of magical fires, you sneak out of the room, fleeing from your captor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17005;That was close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos17006;Just a few words before the ritual is complete, [From.GetFirstName] manages to get free of [From.GetHerHis] boundaries, interrupting the ritual. Even worse, the backlash of the broken spell creates enough of a distraction to allow the prisoner to escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos17006;Gahhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual, but after the spell has been completed, something seem to go wrong. You feel something crawling inside you, but your body cannot handle the stress and you explode all over the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos18005;It would seem the recipient was not appropriate. The spell somehow fails and the prisoner explodes into a bloody pulp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos18005;Just... fetch me some new clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos19005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos19005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos20005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts twisting and burning as the Flamer reshapes it in a cacophony of discordant voices and writhing colours. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos20005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos21005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts bloating and decaying as the Plaguebearer reshapes it in a flurry of rupturing boils and swarming vermin. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos21005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos22;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos22;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos22005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts bloating and decaying as the Plaguebearer reshapes it in a flurry of rupturing boils and swarming vermin. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos22005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos23005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos23005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos24;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos24;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos24005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts writhing and twisting as the Daemonette reshapes it in a storm of flesh and desire. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos24005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos25005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. Yet, something went wrong with the wards. The daemon slips away right after inhabiting the body, free to roam the world unbound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos25005;Curses! So close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has dragged you in [From.GetHerHis] summoning circle to perform some dark ritual. A long series of incomprehensible words are spouted and some blood is spilled and finally a small portal opens and something slips through and crawls inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26;Nnnhghgnnnhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos26005;The summoning is a success: the body of the prisoner starts tearing itself apart as the Bloodletter reshapes it in a wave of bone and blood. The wards bound the creature, who awaits for your commands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos26005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos27;You've prepared the summoning circle and all the needed materials to temporarily open a portal to the Warp and summon a daemon into this world. Which creature should you call?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos27;I call forth a Flamer of Tzeentch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos27;I call forth a Plaguebearer of Nurgle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos27;I call forth a Daemonette of Slaanesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos27;I call forth a Bloodletter of Khorne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEschaos27;I call forth a K'daai of Hashut!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos28;Despite your best efforts, the circle was not strong enough to contain the eldritch energies of the Chaos Realm. The Warp breaks through and a host of cavorting daemons drags you with them to meet their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos28;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos29;The Flamer slowly takes form before you, a collection of mouths and gooey limbs spitting fire and steaming ichor. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos29;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos30;The Plaguebearer slowly takes form before you, a humanoid creature with rotten skin, skinny limbs and a bloated belly filled with worms and decayed entrails. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos30;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos31;The Daemonette slowly takes form before you, an alluring androgynous creature with pale, silken skin bounded by hard chitin. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos31;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos32;The Bloodletter slowly takes form before you, a screaming red-skinned monster eager for battle.  The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos32;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos33;There's a creature of one of my Master's enemies in this land. I cannot tolerate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos33;Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos34;We are many and our Master is one. It's time to drag the wizard to our home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos34;Yessss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos35;In your pride you thought the host of daemons in your service would be easy to control. But you were wrong: the creature of the Warp have banded against you and, easily overcoming your powers, they drag you screaming into the Realm of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos35;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos38;A ravenous Bloodletter of Khorne has come to you, offering you promises of future conquests and victories and standing ready to do your bidding. Or so it says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos38;A decayed Plaguebearer of Nurgle has come to you, offering its eternal love and plenty of gifts from its Dark Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos38;A luscious Daemonette of Slaanesh has come to you, offering you to lead you through uncharted heights of pleasure and joy. Or so she claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos38;A raving Flamer of Tzeentch has come to you, offering you the power of the endless fires of the Changer of Ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEschaos38;A searing K'daai of Hashut has come to you, offering you the might and riches of the Bullfather's forges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos38;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos38;I don't need you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DEMON_HUNT;Daemon Hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos40;There is a nefarious presence plaguing this province. A daemonic being might be at work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos40;It won't hide for longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos42;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has tracked down a daemon hiding in your lands. The Witch Hunter is certain of the existence of the creature and requires your support to trap and cleanse it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos42;Yes, destroy it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos42;We have other things to worry about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos43;You've received support from your liege and are ready to spring the trap on the daemon and cleanse the land from its evil influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos43;Let us proceed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos44;The creature of Chaos revealed itself to be stronger than the Witch Hunter's faith. [From.GetFirstName]'s remains were found scattered in the main square, alongside the entrails of the soldiers you provided [From.GetHerHim] with. There is no trace of the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos44;The gods protect us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos45;A nosy Witch Hunter has managed to find out about your familiar. The daemon revealed itself to be more cunning than [From.GetHerHim] and managed to kill [From.GetHerHim], but it was also put on the run, rescinding the contract which was binding it to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos45;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos46;The accursed mortals have managed to trap you. You fight for as long as you can, but the Witch Hunters are finally able to send you screaming back to the Chaos Realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos46;Grreeaaaahhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos47;An accursed Witch Hunter, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] has managed to trap and destroy your familiar. Luckly for now, the connection between the two of you remains hidden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos47;Damnations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos48;After the cleansing of the daemon, you've spent a lot of time trying to figure out who the wicked creature of darkness was serving and you've finally concluded it must have been [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos48;No one can escape the righteous wrath of Sigmar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos49;"The Witch Hunter [From.GetFirstName] has managed to rally some ridiculous sort of ""proof"" regarding you consorting with daemons and demands now your confession.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos49;*Appeal to liege*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos49;*Banish the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos49;*Imprison the Witch Hunter*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos50;[From.GetTitledFirstName] stands accused, by [FromFrom.GetFirstName], on charges of consorting with daemons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos50;Burn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos50;This is just posturing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos50;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in the darkest dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos51005;Papa Nurgle has brought forth good tidings and plentiful bounties for all the good people in the world. Today its servant has decided to honour you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos51005;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos53;[From.GetFirstName] craves to see what your worth is or spill your blood for Khorne. Would you accept the daemon's challenge and fight with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos53;Let's fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos53;You're beneath me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos54;The fight goes on until the daemon is prone on the ground, leaking ichor from numerous wounds. You're tired, but you've learned something more about battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos54;This is your place, vermin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos55;You try your best, but nobody ends the fight as victor. Even worse, the Bloodletter manages to sink its claws deep in your flesh a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos55;Grrnnhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos56;Despite your efforts, the daemon swiftly overcomes your defences and tears your body apart, leaving you near-dead on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos56;Gllfgrrnnthh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos57;You push the daemon back time and again and such is your display of violence that you feel the gaze of Khorne bearing upon you, granting your body new strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos57;Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos58;Your Master seems a little lonely. Maybe the mortal would like to spend some quality time with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos58;HmmmHmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos59;[From.GetFirstName] awaits you inside your rooms. The daemonette lures you in your bed, whispering honeyed words and promising you to unravel secrets from beyond the veil, if only you'd let her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos59;Yes, please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos59;Maybe another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos60;The lips of the daemon feel cold at the first kiss, but they quickly gain an exotic and irresistible flavour. And at every new taste of her, you feel as if your mind is opening to new horizons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos60;More, more!...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos60;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos61;The whispers within your mind are getting louder. There is no doubt something else has found home within your body and is now struggling to wrestle its control from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos61;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos63;Your blood boils to the point of burning your flesh from the inside out. The daemon inside you keeps on tearing at your soul, taking away whatever is left of your consciousness, until your body has been completely transfigured and there is nothing left of you inside it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos63;One malady after the other, the daemon has completely devastated your body, to the point you yourself can barely recognize it. In the unimaginable suffering you are submitted to by your flesh slowly rotting away and worms feeding off your entrails, you finally accept the daemon's welcoming embrace to oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCschaos63;No mortal indulgence can satiate your cravings any more. The burning desire instilled by the daemon is too much to bear, and it finally breaks your mind entirely as the daemon starts feasting on your soul, one delicious piece at a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDschaos63;More and more mutations wreck your body, repurposing it to the daemon's whims. At every change, you lose another part of yourself, until there's finally nothing left but the unholy creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos63;BLOOD AND SKULLS!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos63;The Great Father watches over you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos63;Time for some *real* fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos63;Krlleeaaaach!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos64;A never-ending rage burns through your body. You cannot rest, you cannot sleep, even the slightest wrong sends you into a roaring rampage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos64;Blood! BLOOOD!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos65;You tighten your hold on the courtier's neck, your vision blurred by rage. You don't know who that is or what he did to you, you only know that you won't find peace until you've disembowelled him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos65;Die! Die! DIE!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66;People feel safe in passing their titles to their children. They grow lazy heirs. Worthless! The only right by blood is the one gained by spilling that of your enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66;Only the strongest rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos66005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has issued a declaration regarding all [From.GetHerHis] vassals: from this day forward, all of your lands will be inherited only by those who show themselves worthy of them by testing their mettle in battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos66005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos67;You first started just to crave more from your favourite sex, but now your lust has grown insatiable. Men, women, children... Nothing can sate your appetites any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos67;More! More!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos68;You pin the courtier on the wall and start tearing apart their clothes with inhuman strength. Your vision is blurred and you've yet to realize if you caught a man or a woman, but that surprise will be part of the fun when you slam yourself on them and start having your way with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos68;No, no, don't keep quiet! I liked you screaming...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos69;You crawl on the table, reaching for another plate further away from your reach. You've not stopped eating since morning, but the more the pain in your stomach grows, the more you feel compelled stuffing it more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos69;Glmmglrrghh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos70;You've nearly turned blind with the last barrel of wine and cannot stand on your feet any longer, but you still crawl to the next. You've lost your chalice, therefore you just hug the cask and start suckling from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos70;Glglglgllglh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71;Why do you have to be bothered entertaining all those ugly, old harpies? From now on, only young and beautiful men shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71;Why do you have to have only ugly, old men as your servant? From now on, only young and beautiful women shall be allowed in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71;Now we'll finally have someone interesting around here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only men will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaos71005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that henceforth only women will hold any position of worth inside [From.GetHerHis] realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos71005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos72;You sneeze once more a copious amount of snot dropping on your chest and dripping all over your clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos72;Bleah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos73;Scores of boils have appeared all over your body, another of the charming gifts bestowed upon you by the daemon inside you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos73;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos74;A terrible fever has struck you, weakening your body and giving you horrible visions of the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos74;Ggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos75;You can barely sleep any longer. You can feel the presence of the daemon inside you, whispering, pulling your flesh from the inside, turning it into something monstrous. You can see every little detail of your body which is slowly changing, while being unable to do anything about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos75;No, no, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76;To each his own, and to everyone something. Your realm will be better off with the lands and title divided unevenly between all. It's certain to create a lot of interesting situations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76;Indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos76005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all lands to be split on death of their possessor between all of their heirs, with the main beneficiary being the one with the most support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos76005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77;Control is but an illusion, why pretend it to exist in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77;No more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos77005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed all laws of the realm to be null and void. Only the rule of the strong and cunning will determine the loyalty of the servants towards the masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos77005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78;Everybody expect the firstborn to be the favourite, everybody grooms him to be the best. It is the turn of the youngest now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78;Truly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos78005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decreed that enceforth all lands shall be inherited by the youngest sons and daughters of the realm and no longer the eldest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos78005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos79005;Luckly you manage to ambush [From.GetFirstName] with the help of a few guards and start reciting the exorcism as they bind [From.GetHerHim]. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you see the daemon being torn from [From.GetHerHis] with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos79005;Praised be [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, until finally you feel the daemon being torn from you with excruciating resistance and be banished into the warp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80005;You can feel it now: the daemon leaving you was nothing but an illusion! The presence has resurfaced again, gnawing at your soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80005;Not again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos80006;It would seem your spell did not in fact succeeded in freeing [From.GetTitledFirstName] from the evil presence hiding inside [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos80006;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has managed to ambush you with the help of a few guards and is now starting to recite some ominous spell while the others bind you. The chanting goes on for hours, but the daemon has sunk its teeth inside you and doesn't let the body go without dragging your soul away as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81;Aaaarrgghh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos81005;While the exorcism started for the better, the daemon did not leave its host without consequences: the foul creature dragged away the soul of [From.GetTitledFirstName], leaving an empty and lifeless shell behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos81005;Curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos82;The daemon struggles as the last shred of life leaves your body. The welcoming cold of death is a balm for your mind and you can only laugh at the now-desperate attempts of the ethereal creature to hold onto you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos82;No soul left to eat. Time to leave, pathetic creature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos83;You cannot rest, nightmares of lightning and blood tear your mind every time you try to sleep.\n'YOU DARE TO CLAIM BLOOD AND GLORY WITH COWARDLY MEANS?! HOW CAN YOU KEEP DISHONORING YOURSELF WITH MAGIC!?!.'\nIn every dream the great armoured hound looks down upon you from his throne, berating and belittling you.\n'I HAVE NO USE FOR WEAKLINGS AND DECEIVERS!';;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos83;Continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos83;Then take away the stain of magic, Lord of Skulls, so that I may serve you better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos84;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has requested you to prepare a summoning circle, for [From.GetSheHe] desires for you to call a daemon from the Realms of Chaos and bind the creature into [From.GetHerHis] service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos84;Very well, I shall do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos84;No. It's not worth the risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos85;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your request, pointing you out the dangers of opening a portal to the Realm of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos85;Hmpf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos86;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted your requests. When the fateful night comes, [From.GetSheHe] prepares the summoning circle and all the needed ingredients and, with you at [From.GetHerHis] side, starts chanting the summoning spell that will bring a daemon into your world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos87;You are not sure of what is happening until too late: the ritual has failed. A host of terrifying daemons break through the summoning circle to drag you and the sorcerer into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos87;Noooooo!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos88;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a raving Flamer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos88;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos89;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a decomposing Plaguebearer to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos89;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos90;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind an alluring Daemonette to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos90;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos91;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a brutal Bloodletter to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos91;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92;The Blood God watches over you from his throne of skulls. What is your offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos92;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92001;The Lord of Skulls is pleased with your offering. With a flash of fire and a burst of blood, a daemonic apparition floats down from the sky, allowing you to pick a boon of your choosing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92001;Some of your warriors, to crush my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos92001;Fill me with your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos92001;Fill me with your energy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92002;The Lord of Skulls must be pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature tears its way into reality to offer its services to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92002;You'll follow my orders from now on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92003;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with unholy rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92003;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92004;The ground cracks and a great river of blood bursts forth to cover you and your followers. Clearly the Lord of Skulls looks you favourably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92004;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92005;The Blood God favours you. As your offering burns, you feel yourself filling with rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92005;Raaaahhhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92006;The smoke of your offering creates intricate designs, you can see the grand design of your patron, finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92006;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos92008;Despite your effort, the Lord of Skulls has not reacted to your offering. Perhaps you've not given enough to satiate his thirst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos92008;Grmmmh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93;Papa Nurgle is always ready to dispense his gifts to all who are in need. All the same, he's happy to receive offering from his own followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos93;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93001;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious fog and a jolly voice resonates in your ears, thanking you for your gift and asking to pick a boon of your choosing in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93001;I wish to receive magic, to better spread your gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos93001;I wish my servants to love me as I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos93001;I wish to share your gifts with all of my servants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93002;Papa Nurgle must be really pleased with you, for after you offering has been burned, a daemonic creature claws out of the ground, ready to hug and serve you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93002;I'm so happy to meet you, friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93003;As your offering burns, you feel the love of Nurgle filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93003;Why can't we just all get along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93004;The smoke of your offering covers the field with a noxious green fog, undoubtedly proving the Lord of the Flies' unconditional love for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93004;I love you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93005;As your offering burns, you feel Nurgle's generosity filling your heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93005;Let everyone share in his gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93006;The fumes of the pyre fill your lungs and you can see the marvellous future the Lord of Flies has in store for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93006;I'm coming Papa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos93008;Papa Nurgle has certainly accepted your present, but it could be that others are in greater need of his gifts than you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos93008;Don't worry, I'll wait for next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94;The Serpent always thirsts for more delights and greedily takes anything which is offered up. What will you offer Slaanesh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos94;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94001;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. Your offering has momentarily pleased your Master, to the point they'll grant you a gift of your choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94001;Grant me mastery over the Winds of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos94001;Make me beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos94001;Heal my body so that I may be whole again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94002;One of the bodies on the pyre stands up and shakes off the flames, shambling away from the others. As it moves, the flesh crawls and flickers and when it reaches you, you realize it is a daemon, a gift from the Dark Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94002;Let us know each other, yes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94003;Like a beacon, the pyre draws a black pegasus to the field. The wild creature descends upon you and bows at your feet, clearly a gift from the Serpent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94003;How about turning around now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94004;The Dark Prince's voice resonates in your mind, you can feel his touch crawling beneath your skin. The Serpent's sweet words clearly show you must be amongst his favourites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94004;Never doubted it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94005;As the flames burn on the pyre, so too does a new lust inflame your soul, rekindled by the Dark Prince's touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94005;Hmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94006;The bodies on the pyre create the most interesting shapes while they burn. You can see the artistry of your Master behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94006;Yes... yes it is so clear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos94008;You've waited until the last embers have gone cold, but there has been no response from your Master. The Dark Prince must have a poor disposition today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos94008;Rats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95;The Changer of Ways is fickle in his rewards and greedy in his requests. What shall you give to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95;The greatest pyre to ever burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95;A great offering, so that he might remember me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95;A large offering, so that he might notice me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDschaos95;A small offering, to show my loyalty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95001;Motes of unnatural light dance over the pyre and you can feel the Architect of Fate is looking at you, ready to grant your heart's desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95001;Magic! Grant me the true power of Chaos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaos95001;Knowledge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCschaos95001;More power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95002;One of the bodies on the pyre explodes in a shower of gore. The melted remains come together into an unnatural shrieking mix, a daemonic gift from your Master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95002;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95003;As the smoke rises, you can feel the touch of Tzeentch upon you. The Changer of Ways has given you his greatest gift: magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95003;Power over reality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95004;The shining smokes and twisting flames undoubtedly show the favour of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95004;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95005;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95005;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95006;The Architect of Fate has looked at your offer and filled your mind with new and greater plans for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95006;Yes, there's greatness in store for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos95008;The Great Plotter's plan is yet to be uncovered. Nothing happened after your offering was sent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos95008;Next time... next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos96;The Gods blessed you on the fields of battle today. Your patron's eye is looking right inside your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos96;I am victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos97;Only the best survive the endless trials of the gods. You are more than all the others, you are a true champion of your patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos97;Glorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos98;There is no doubt your god has something special in mind for you. You have received many gifts and have ascended as a chosen servant of your deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos98;I shall be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaos99;The time has come. You've endured hardship, you've survived all of your patron's generous gifts, you've outdone the efforts of others to please your deity, and he has finally rewarded you with the ultimate gift: you leave your old husk and in a storm of twisting bone and melding flesh you achieve apotheosis and are reborn as an immortal Daemon Prince.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos99;Reaaaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos100;[From.GetFirstName] struggles desperately within your clutches, but it's too late for [From.GetHerHim]. You open your jaws and suck [From.GetHerHis] delicious soul from the pathetic husk, feasting upon [From.GetHerHis] essence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos100;Marvellous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos101;The terrible daemon who captured you has the worst in store for you: dragging you out of your cage with its claws, the creature reaps your soul out of the body and feasts upon it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos101;Hhhhhhhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos102;The host of daemons emerges from the aether, ready to follow your lead and scourge the lands of the mortals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaos102;March!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaos104;Your daemonic forces disband, dragged back into the Realms of Chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1;You're challenge has been issued and so it echoes across the plains: you will organize a great tournament to please Khorne and gain his favour. Any who believes himself worthy of the gaze of Skull God will gather and you will all fight and bleed and kill until only one remains to bask in the triumph of ultimate victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1;BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1900;It's been a long journey, but you're finally back home. A great challenge for Khorne can only be organized every so often, it'll be decades before another one may be issued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1900;I'll just kill in some other way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1001;I challenge you, scum!\n I call upon you to shed blood in name of Khorne! Meet me and any others who will heed this call at the plains and face my wrath! Only the strongest will survive to bask in the glory of Lord of Skulls!!\n\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1001;I'll rip your heart OUT!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaosfl1001;You're not worthy of my blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1002;You miserable worm!\n Ready yourself to depart from this world! Before the next moon the Bloodletters will feast upon your wretched soul as I claim my rightful place at Khorne's side!\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1002;Ah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl1003;The boasts of the weak do not concern me,\n shriek and batter your chest won't make you a worthy adversary to fell with my blade.\n\n  [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl1003;Coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAschaosfl2;Several warriors have answered to your call, gathering in the barren plain chosen for the deadly tournament in honor of the Lord of Skulls. Not all are challengers, the word of the great bloodbath caught the attention of many aspiring champions, wanderers, curious and traders.\n Once you and the other challengers are reunited, all of the other followers surround you, looking towards you in anticipation.\n Above them, the tattered tabards with Khorne's rune blow in a hot wind, their poles already surrounded by little offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBschaosfl2;Not enough warriors came at your call. The plain lies empty before you, with just some curious cultists roaming around, squabbling over minor quarrels. You've waited for a few days now and it is certain no one else will come.\n It is with great regret that you announce you are forced to cancel the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2;BlOOD! BLOOD AND SKULLS!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBschaosfl2;This was a waste of time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2001;Several warriors have answered [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s call, gathering in the barren plain chosen for the deadly tournament in honor of the Lord of Skulls. Not all are challengers, the word of the great bloodbath caught the attention of many aspiring champions, wanderers, curious and traders.\n Once you and the other challengers are reunited, all of the other followers surround you, looking towards you in anticipation.\n Above them, the tattered tabards with Khorne's rune blow in a hot wind, their poles already surrounded by little offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2001;BlOOD! BLOOD AND SKULLS!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2002;As the first challenger it is only right that you have the honor of starting the deathmatch. Khorne only favours the ruthless and the strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAschaosfl2002;Glory to Khorne! Face me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCschaosfl2003;It is your turn to fight for the glory of Khorne and yourself. You walk towards the centre of the plain, accompanied by the cheering of the cultists sitting and standing in the field around you.

EVTDESCDARKELF.10;You have raided for a long time now and amassed great wealth. Perhaps it is time to stop, before your luck runs out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.12.a;Inform the crew - we bathe in blood tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.12.b;Inform the crew - we bathe in blood tonight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.12;Off the coast of the Old World one night you spot lights ahead; it seems to be a small village. Do you want to go in and and pillage it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.13;You silently sail up to the village, and then stealthily slip your warriors around it before unleashing a great war cry - the slaughter is glorious, and you take many slaves as captives!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.14;You get your warband ashore, but as soon as you approach the village an alarm goes off, and worse still the militia are reinforced by a contingent of patrolling knights! Curses - this village is too heavily defended!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.15;You come across a merchant convoy of human ships. There are three of them, but it looks like they are not warships. Prepare to board them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.15.a;Corsairs - full sail! Prepare for boarding action!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.15.b;No, attacking three ships is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.16.a;Bolt throwers, prepare to cut down their masts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.16.b;Damnation. Three on one, hardly favourable. Time to withdraw.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.16;Spotting your sail, the ships turn towards you - brave fools, are they are actually going to try and fight you?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.17.a;And they had a rich cargo too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.17;Your bolt throwers expertly disable the sails of two of the ships, leaving them dead in the water. Your crew board the other ship, and one by one, the others fall to. The sailors are cut down when they resist, with a choice selection of slaves picked from the 'lucky' survivors. This is a great victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.18.a;Turn about, we'll outsail these scows!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.18;Your bolt throwers failed to disable the approaching ships, and one of them carries a catapult which sends its own missiles your way. If one of them hits, it could be the end of you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.19.a;Prepare to repel boarders - bolt throwers, fire at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.19;Curses! An Eagle Ship from Ulthuan has spotted your sail, and is fast approaching. You can't outrun the warship sent by your vile cousins, you'll have to try to repel their attack...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.2;Your liege's court is crowded, and it's time to thin the herd. By getting rid of your competitors, your own favour in the eyes of your liege can only increase...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.21.a;We claim their ship, it will fetch a good price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.21;Your cousins catch up to you but you managed to disable their bolt thrower with your own counter-strikes. A fierce boarding action ensues, but the hatred and ferocity of your crew overcomes the attempt, and soon the high elves are all dead, or fated for much worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.22;A deadly shooting match ensues, you manage to do serious damage to their sails, but your own ship has been battered as well. It's time to attempt one last shot at their main mast, otherwise it looks like you won't be able to flee...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.23;You have become wounded, and can no longer carry on the raiding life. It is time to return to your home and regain your strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.24;Though temporarily defeated, you will never give up your claims to your ancestral homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.3;While working on one of your schemes, a rival at court has emerged. You will have to work towards destroying this individual before you yourself are destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.4.b;Do not bother me with this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.4;Court rumours say that one of your courtiers has gained a rival at court; it should be interesting to see how this plays out in the future as they work towards foiling each other's schemes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.5.a;A most excellent deal. Throw [From.GetHerHim] in the cells!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.5.b;A most excellent deal. Throw [From.GetHerHim] in the cells!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.5;A group of corsairs have captured a noble, and offer to sell him to you for a small fee. He is surely worth more than that in ransom... or else he would make a worthy sacrifice to Khaine?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.6.a;W-wait... am I in... Naggaroth?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.6.b;I'll get out... and when I do...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.6;You pass out, and after days or weeks of fever dreams lying wounded on a ship somewhere, you wake up in a dark dungeon. Gods, where is this place, and why is it so dark and cold?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.7.a;500 gold? Sounds like a bargain... Dwarf slaves live for at least 20 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.7.b;500 gold? Sounds like a bargain... Dwarf slaves live for at least 20 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.7.c;Do not bother me with this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.8.a;Certainly, I shall return with slaves and plunder!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.8.b;Certainly, I shall return with slaves and plunder!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.8;You are a noble of Naggaroth, and you can outfit an expedition to go raiding abroad for the glory of Khaine and the Witch King. Do you wish to start looking for a ship and crew?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDARKELF.9.a;Curses! But hate will carry me on...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDARKELF.9;You have become maimed, and can no longer carry on the raiding life. It is time to return to your home, and let others lead from the front lines while you carefully manage your wealth and power from your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.15;And so it has come to pass that not a man but a woman trained in the arcane arts defeated the Witch King. For centuries Malekith forbade men from practising magic under his lands, needlessly fearing for a prophecy which is clear now he so greatly misunderstood.

EVTDESCB_druchiiinv.15;And so it has come to pass that a mage defeated the Witch King, just as Caledor prophesied.

EVTDESCC_druchiiinv.15;And so it has come to pass that a commoner defeated the Witch King. For centuries Malekith forbade men from practising magic under his lands, fearing the a mage would have been born and trained in the arcane art, become more powerful than him and destroy him, like Caledor prophesied. Yet, in the end, it was through mundane means that the Witch King of Naggaroth found his end. This is a great day for the Asur, as their greatest enemy has been defeated and the remaining Druchii will soon fight amongst themselves for his legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.15;A great accomplishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLE_druchiiinv.15;The Witch King dies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.16;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has grown weary of the squabbling of [From.GetHerHis] subjects. Unleashing [From.GetHerHis] host of spies and informants, [From.GetSheHe] is surveying Naggaroth to cut down any attempt at insurrection. You, as well as your supporters, have decided it might be best to dissolve your factions for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.16;Our time will come again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.18;You've discovered another amongst your servants, [From.GetTitledFirstName], who thought he could secretely practice the dark arts to grow more powerful than you and kill you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCB_druchiiinv.18;There is no doubt about it: your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] shows the gift of a sorcerer-to-be. Why else would he have hid this from you if not to plot against your throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.18;I shall not die by your sorcery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv.18;The prophecy must not be fulfilled. Not even by you, my son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.19;The Witch-King discovered of your meddling with the dark arts and has quickly sent his best assassins to deal with you. Before you can even react, the shadowy druchii sink their blades in your back time and again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.19;Hhhggghhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22;All able-bodied young Naggarothi are expected to serve the Witch King in the Black Guard army for a hundred-years draft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22;I will ask permission to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22001;All able-bodied young Naggarothi are expected to serve the Witch King in the Black Guard army for a hundred-years draft. [From.GetFirstName] has reached the proper age, the officers from Naggarond will soon come to take [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22001;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv22001;I can convince them to do otherwise…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22002;[From.GetFirstName] has not opposed the Witch King's edict. It is time for you to depart and join the Black Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22003;[From.GetFirstName] has used bribes and threats against the Naggarondi officiers to prevent you from leaving court. It seems you shall avoid the draft entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22003;I see…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22004;Your draft has finally come to an end. In this years you've come to trust and rely on the men of your regiment, will you abandon them to resume your duties as a Naggarothi nobleman or will you stay in the Black Guard forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22004;I will stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv22004;Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided that he will never return, taking his place as a Black Guard permanently in the army of the Witch King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22005;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv22006;The training in the army is no less cutthroat than the rest of druchii society. Sadly it appears you did not have what it takes to be a Black Guard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv22006;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has felt the call of Khaine and decided to become a Witch Elf. As Khaine is a jealous god, she won't be able to marry anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBdruchiiinv23;I won't allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23001;You have devoted yourself to the Lord of Murder, giving away your possessions and proclaiming yourself to be his bride. In these following years you shall train and learn the rites and secrets of the Witches, so that you may better serve your master.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23001;For Khaine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23002;Years have passed, but, despite your fervor, you were judged lacking in the eyes of the Lord of Murder. A Khainite Assassin has been sent to dispose of you and, as the lights go out, you are made aware in a cold whisper that you have failed your god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23002;Hghhh…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23003;For years you have trained and bathed in the blood of your enemies, offering their beating hearts at the altar of Khaine. The Lord of Murder looks favourably upon you and the other Witch Elves have come to see you as a respected member of their coven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23003;As they should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23004;No mercy and no love. The Lord of Murder beckons death and suffering and in the rivers of blood shed in his honor, you cannot feel anything but excitement and anticipation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23004;Their screams are like music.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23005;The horrors and peril in the church of Khaine have ironed your soul and sharpened your senses. You no longer feel fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23005;Only you should be afraid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23006;The constant strain of the savage rituals and the blood-soaked campaigns have made you stronger and faster than the ordinary elf. Few can hold their own against you in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23006;Their blood for my strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23007;Khaine rules over death, none can escape his grasp, neither the greatest warrior nor the wisest sorcerer, all pay tribute to the Lord of Murder in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23007;For Khaine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23008;Working with blades and daggers day and night can certainly leave the mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23008;Each scar brings glory to Khaine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23009;All Witches are Khaine's brides. He is a jealous god and does not tolerate any man to touch them. Yet, you've found there's another kind of solace to be found in his halls, warmer and softer than what the god's statue can provide…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23009;Hmm…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23010;Through discipline and training, your mind resonates, touched by the sublime designs of the Lord of Murder, and opens to new strategies and dreams of slaughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23010;Show me the way…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23011;In the frenzy of last night's ritual, some of your sisters were overcome by Khaine's bloodlust and attacked you. Unable to resist to all of them, you barely managed to survive, albeit seriously wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23011;Grrnpfh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv23012;Death and blood course through your veins, you can hear Khaine's voice whispering to you, telling you of his next victims, sharpening your will and senses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv23012;I'm ready to do your bidding, o Lord of Murder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv24001;The Witch Elves come at night, silent and deadly, but it is not your blood they seek. Snatched from your palace, you're brought shrieking at the Alter of Khaine and baptised in blood. You shall live with the brides of the Lord of Murder and become an Assassin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv24001;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCdruchiiinv24002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been kidnapped! The Witch Elves sneaked in at night and took the infant from [From.GetHerHis] crib. Though many children do not survive in the church of Khaine, [From.GetFirstName] might be skilled and blessed enough to do so and grow into a deadly Assassin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv24002;For the glory of Khaine…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCA_druchiiinv.12005;Tha big bad beasty goz down an' eatz dead the bad boy. Makes other bad boyz turn good and tha' why good Bosses have big beasties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAdruchiiinv.12005;Rumpfh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SJDwarfevents.1.desc;There are a large variety of beers available at the feast. You have already had five flagons, it may be a good idea to stop drinking...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.1.option1;And I will drink five flagons more!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.1.option2;I am a Dwarf, not a drunkard!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.2.desc;Your miners have found a rich vein of high quality gold ore which the miners have eagerly started to work on.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.2.option1;What a pleasant surprise!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.3.desc;A confused Dwarf has been found strolling around in the caves beneath [Capital.GetName]. He asks for your permission to stay at your court until he remembers who he was before and where he comes from.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.3.option1;You can stay;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.3.option2;I got more important things to worry about.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.4.desc;Masonry is an old Dwarf tradition. Compared to the other lesser races, it is highly sophisticated and very respected. A Dwarf mason does not only work with building residential areas but they also are the ones who have the honourable task of building the huge halls and intriguing chambers that cover most of the Dwarf Karaks. As these structures are some of the most magnificent in the known world so are the Dwarf masons rightfully regarded as the best masons in the world which they are fully aware of and find great pride in. Masonry isn't just a way to build their homes, it is an art form.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.4.option1;Glory to the Dwarfs!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.5.desc;You have tried to make a small statue of a Dwarf warrior. Despite the fact it barely resembles a Dwarf and the axe is way too small, it is still an improvement since before.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.5.option1;A good attempt;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.6.desc;Your attempt at making a small statue of a Dwarf warrior failed miserably. Halfway through you accidentally broke the statue which probably didn't matter as the statue would have looked awful anyway.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.6.option1;What a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.7.desc;There is a very rough wall in one the watchtowers in [Capital.GetName] which you have decided to smooth out. The wall actually ended up quite smooth even though there are some scratches in it.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.7.option1;A good attempt;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.8.desc;There is a very rough wall in one of your watchtowers in [Capital.GetName] which you have decided to smooth out.But the wall ended up looking even worse than it was before and very unstable.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.8.option1;We will have to rebuild the wall then...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.9.desc;You have decided to join your masons in their daily work, you learnt a lot of new stuff and you are very confident that you can put that practice to the test.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.9.option1;Very interesting;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.10.desc;You have decided to join your masons in their daily work. they carefully gave you some tips, but you had a very tough time understanding what they meant so you did not learn that much.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.10.option1;What a shame;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.11.desc;You have decided to smooth out the very uneven floor in the throne room. The floor actually ended up quite smooth so you are mighty pleased with yourself now.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.11.option1;I am not that bad of a mason after all!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.12.desc;You have lately been smoothing out a rough part of floor in the throne room, but it ended in a complete disaster and you wouldn't be surprised if the floor is even more uneven now than before.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.12.option1;I am so ashamed of myself...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.13.desc;Your skills in masonry have improved significantly. You are now at the level of your own masons. Considering how good Dwarfs are at masonry it is quite an achievement!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.13.option1;I am now a fully fledged mason!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.14.desc;You decided a while back to engrave the pillars in your throne room, that you have now finally finished. The elaborate runes cover most of the pillars that stand firmly in your throne room.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.14.option1;Well done, [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.15.desc;You decided some time ago to engrave the pillars in your throne room. But you have at several points in the engraving accidentally left large cracks in the pillars so you sadly need to build new ones.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.15.option1;Well that's annoying!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.16.desc;You have for the last weeks been working on rebuilding the entrance to the castle as the entrance was very battered. The entrance now looks sturdier than ever before which pleases you enormously.;;:;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.16.option1;Well done, [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.17.desc;While repairing the castle's entrance, it accidentally collapsed in on itself so you have been forced to reinforce the garrison with a couple of sellswords to guard the entrance in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.17.option1;How unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.18.desc;The reparations of the castles battlements have gone far better than expected, the battlements are not only stronger but also considerably more redoubtable!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.18.option1;That will ward off any attackers;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.19.desc;The widening of the castle's battlements has not gone as planned as it ended up being very unstable and it has collapsed at some points along the wall. A complete rebuild of the walls is necessary.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.19.option1;Oh oh...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.20.desc;Your rival deserves to feel pain and what better way to make someone feel pain than to destroy what that person loves. In this case it is your rivals statues...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.20.option1;Say goodbye to your statues!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.20.option2;No, that is below me;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.21.desc;One morning when you come down to your statue workshop you suddenly see most of the statues have been crushed by some heavy tool. Several years of work now lie shattered on the floor.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.21.option1;MY STATUES!!!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.22.desc;[From.GetTitledName] has finally felt the pain that [From.GetSheHe] deserves. Rumours say that [From.GetSheHe] is devastated by [From.GetHerHis] loss and you can't stop yourself from grinning at the news.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.22.option1;I am so sneaky!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.23.desc;The road network in one of your provinces is severely lacking after a small flood which destroyed most of the bridges. But you and your masons might be able to rebuild them again...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.23.option1;And we will build them even better this time;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.23.option2;I wasn't planning on travelling there anyway;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.desc;You haven't thought for a long time about creating a statue of one of three most important of the Ancestral Gods - Valaya, Grimnir or Grungni. But who will you choose?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option1;Grimnir, the warrior!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option2;Grungni, the smith!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option3;Valaya, the protector!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option4;I don't believe in Gods!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.25.desc;Your hated rival can finally pay the final price which is nothing less than your rival's death! You have been thinking about a masterful plan involving some highly unstable mining tunnels...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.25.option1;REVENGE!!!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.25.option2;I am not a murderer...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.26.desc;To succeed with your plan you must first find a tunnel that is highly unstable and one that would collapse at a seconds notice. And of course, you also must get your rival to the spot...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.26.option1;The sweet taste of revenge!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.27.desc;While walking around in the tunnels you suddenly get interrupted by a loud rumbling sound. You begin to run back and you barely manage to get away from the tunnel before it collapses.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.27.option1;That was to close!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.28.desc;While walking around in the tunnels you suddenly get interrupted by a loud rumbling sound. You begin to run back but you don't get far before a huge rock falls down upon you, killing you immediately.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.28.option1;Noooooo!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.29.desc;The plan was a failure. [From.GetName] managed to escape in time barely avoiding the large pieces of rock falling from the celling.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.29.option1;What a shame;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.30.desc;Your plan was a success! The falling boulders crushed [From.GetName], killing [From.GetHerHim] instantly.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.30.option1;I am so good at intrigue;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.31.desc;You have put your masonry skills to the test and started building a completely new mining system in one of your provinces and it ended up very successfully.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.31.option1;Excellent;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.32.desc;You are now a masterful mason! There are few limits to what you can and cannot build and other Dwarfs often look upon you with envy in their eyes.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.32.option1;Sounds exciting!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.33.desc;You have lately been working on improving your throne room's engravings and you can't stop yourself from being very pleased with the result.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.33.option1;A wonderful throne room made by a wonderful [Root.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.34.desc;You have for a long time thought about making a large statue of yourself and then put that statue in some place where everyone can see it, like the entrance for example.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.34.option1;I am worthy of the honour!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.34.option2;Pride goes before fall;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.35.option2;This was a one time thing;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.36.desc;The Human beer served to you was nowhere near the taste of Dwarf beer, almost making you vomit. You feel a big urge to tell them exactly what you feel about their so called beer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.36.option1;Are you trying to poison me, manling!?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.36.option2;I guess I better get used to the taste...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.desc;You have recently invited the Dwarf [From.GetName] for a drink or two in your chamber but when [From.GetSheHe] tried it [From.GetSheHe] immediately started complaining about the beverages served.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.option1;No we DO NOT have Dwarf beer here so stop complaining!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.option2;I think you will like my Dwarf beer more...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.option3;I should have bought some Dwarf beer before I invited [From.GetHerHim] over;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.38.desc;[From.GetName] got very angry when I voiced my opinion about the awful Human beer served and [From.GetSheHe] dismissed me with all of the needed courtesy.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.38.option1;Hah, weak Manlings!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.39.desc;When you voiced your opinion on the coloured water that the Humans call beer [From.GetSheHe] gave you some Dwarf beer instead. The conversation continued on smoothly with the help of a beer or two...;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.39.option1;Nothing can beat Dwarf beer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.40.desc;Is it the Manlings who keep the Orcs at bay? Are the Elflings famous for their engineering? No, it is the Dwarfs and only Dwarfs who can do that and we should be proud of that!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.40.option1;We are glorious!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.40.option2;Pride goes before fall;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.42.desc;An ordinary part in a "regular" Dwarf's life is the regular visit to the local tavern to both drink the excellent beer served but to also spend some time with friends. But you are no "regular" Dwarf right?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.42.option1;I should not let my responsibilities weigh me down!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.42.option2;I think I will skip this time;;;;;;;;;
SJDwarfevents.42.option3;I don't have any time for that. Because I got work to do!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.desc;The first things that enter your mind when you walk through the door into the cosy little tavern are the constant laughters and the singing from a dozen drunken Dwarfs on the right side of the tavern. To the left a couple of human merchants sit, trying out the Dwarf beer for the first time with several loud exclamations in their foreign tongue. Most other seats have already been taken by the Dwarf miners who just ended their mining shift and are now eager to have a drink, except for the seats far in the corner to the left who are almost completely covered in shadows. You take some fast steps forward but slow down when you realise that you don't know where to sit.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.option1;I will sit by myself;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.option2;I have always wanted to know humans better;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.option3;I will go and join the singing Dwarfs at their table;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.44.desc;Suddenly a longbearded Dwarf with several large scars enters the tavern. He scans the room with his watchul eyes before he starts to walk towards your table. "May I join?" he asks.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.44.option1;Sure;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.44.option2;Come up with some plausible excuse for saying no;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.45.desc;The veteran tells you some of the most fascinating stories of his adventures. But he also says that he has grown tired of adventuring and wants to settle down. Maybe you could offer him that?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.45.option1;Welcome!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.45.option2;I don't think that would be a good idea;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.46.desc;When you sit by yourself and have nothing to do except for drinking, it is quite hard to resist drinking. Dwarfs can drink a lot without even flinching but there is a limit...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.46.option1;Who can resist proper Dwarf beer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.46.option2;I am a Dwarf, not a drunkard!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.47.desc;Suddenly one of your courtiers appears and sits down at your table. You talk to each other till sunrise even though you barely manage to not fall asleep. Will you contact the courtier again?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.47.option2;It was a one time thing;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.47.option1;We should do that again, my friend!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.48.desc;It doesn't take long for the human traders to try to sell you something. In this case it is a book which they claim comes from one of the lost Dwarf holds.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.48.option1;I will buy it;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.48.option2;It is obviously a fraud;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.49.desc;The book you bought has now been confirmed to be a real one, coming from a hold which must have been destroyed such a long time ago so that no one even knows it's name.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.49.option1;And it contains some very interesting knowledge;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.50.desc;The book you bought is a Dwarf book but instead of containing lost knowledge it is a badly written romantic fiction.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.50.option1;Those humans will pay!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.51.desc;The humans tells you the most fascinating stories about their homeland, giving you a further understanding about how the world is outside your hold. Because that was the truth wasn't it?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.51.option1;Very interesting;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.52.desc;The humans are the representatives of a rich merchant who wants to set up trade with one of the Dwarf holds on a large scale.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.52.option1;I think we can come up with something profitable for both of us!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.53.desc;It seems like the humans were not merchants but instead debt collectors wanting to get their debt paid. You talked to them for a while before excusing yourself.;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.53.option1;I wonder where they are going;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.54.desc;The Dwarfs were an active bunch singing and drinking without any end in sight.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.54.option1;We are having a great time!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.55.desc;You easily take part in their festivities with a wide smile on your face and you think that you have become friends with one of them.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.55.option1;I will never forget this day;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.56.desc;The drunken Dwarfs have challenged you to a drinking competition, will you accept or not?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.56.option1;Of course I will accept it!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.56.option2;No, I got to work tomorrow;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.57.desc;You easily out-drink your opponent and claim the price!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.57.option1;Beer! *belch* I LOVE BEEEEEER!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.58.desc;Your opponent drinks five flagons in a matter of seconds even though he must have drunk several flagons already.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.58.option1;And now I have to pay for all of the beer...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.59.desc;The night at the tavern is finally over so you slowly drag yourself home awaiting the terrible hangover that will soon hit you with the force of a bull.;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.59.option1;What a night!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.desc;Your beard has now grown so long so that you are no longer seen as a beardling but as a fully grown man. But as a lord so are you expected to enlist in the army, but what regiment will you fight in?;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option1;The crossbow-armed Quarrellers!;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option2;The Dwarf warriors!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option3;The handgun-armed Thunderers!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option4;Fighting?! Sounds dangerous...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63a.desc;The quarrellers are powerful missile troops that use their crossbows to kill the enemy at range. The bolts that the crossbow fires may not have the armour penetration of the handguns but they have a superior range instead which can prove many times even more deadly than the handguns. Fighting in a disciplined manner,firing volley after volley with the high precision that the crossbow is so famous for and so they are righteously feared by their enemies and awed by their allies. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the quarrellers already know how to use a crossbow but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63b.desc;The Dwarf warriors are the bulk of the Dwarf military might, locked in a hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Fighting in their famous shieldwall formations, these fierce opponents are close to unstoppable if they manage to keep their formation intact. Every Dwarf warrior uses their own personal armour but most Dwarfs still fight with an axe and shield, and wear a chainmail as well. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the Dwarf warriors already know how to use an axe but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63c.desc;The thunderers use handguns to kill the enemy with great effect. The bullets can penetrate nearly every set of armour killing a charging chaos warrior in an instant. The thunderers shoot in methodical volleys with the screams of their enemies as a direct result of that. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the thunderers already know how to use a handgun but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63.option1;Should I be worried?;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.64a.desc;You manage to hit the target in most of your shots and you feel that your initial worry of failing was probably unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.64b.desc;Each and every swing you make with your axe feels so natural, making you believe that your initial worry of getting failed was probably unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.64.option1;What a relief...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.65.desc;You are utterly hopeless with your weapon and the overseer of the test has at several times sneered at you when he passed by. You won't succeed and you know it.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.65.option1;I can always hope... right?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66a.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a quarreller!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66b.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a Dwarf warrior!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66c.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a thunderer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66.option1;Well done!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.67.desc;You failed the final test miserably and you leave the training field in shame.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.67.option1;I am not worthy of calling myself a Dwarf!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.68.desc;You are of such a great age so that you can now join the veteran regiments on the battlefield. Few Dwarfs get this honour and you can count yourself lucky to be one of them.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.68.option1;I will join the longbeards!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.68.option2;I will join the ironbreakers!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.69.desc;[Liege.GetTitledName] has bestowed the great honour of being in his hammerer bodyguard to you. Only the best and most seasoned warriors may serve in this elite bodyguard.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.69.option1;I accept, my liege;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70a.desc;Your head is not clear enough to serve in the hammerer bodyguard anymore. It may be a wise idea to leave your place vacant so that someone else may join the hammerers instead.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70b.desc;Due to your injury you are sadly not able to stay in the hammerer bodyguard anymore.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70c.desc;Because of the fact that your liege has thrown you into jail you are not allowed to be in the hammerer bodyguard anymore.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70d.desc;Your liege is now a [Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] and can therefore no longer have a hammerer bodyguard. You are no longer a hammerer.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70.option1;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.71.desc;You are no longer a hammerer. Probably due to the fact that the individual you were set to protect no longer is your direct liege.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.71.option1;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.72.desc;In the midst of battle you suddenly realise that you have pushed the enemy so far back so that you are now in the middle of the enemy army. You turn around and try to fight your way back.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.72.option1;I guess I better start fighting my way back;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.73.desc;In the midst of battle you notice that one of your enemies has suddenly charged your regiment. He is far away at the moment but he is moving up fast and the others in the regiment haven't seen him.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.73.option1;You aim your handgun at the enemy.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.74.desc;Far of into the distance you see one of the enemies creating great havoc among your lines. He is very far away but bringing him down would be a great honour and testimony of your skill.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.74.option1;You aim your crossbow at the enemy.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.75a.desc;The best way to improve your fighting skills is to practice, a lot and preferably against real people. Maybe there is someone at your court you could test your fighting skills against?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.75b.desc;The best way to improve your aim is to practice, a lot and competing with others could help. Maybe there is someone at your court you could test your sharpshooting skills against?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.75.option1;I guess I better go find someone;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.76a.desc;You found a sparring partner and he was willing to practice his fighting skills against you. It was a close fight and you think he enjoyed it as much as you did.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.76b.desc;You found a Dwarf and he was willing to practice his aiming skills against you. It was a close match and you think he enjoyed it as much as you did.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.76.option1;What a day!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.77.desc;In the midst of battle you suddenly see a Dwarf without an axe duck and weave from one of your enemies. You begin to run as fast as you can towards the Dwarf before it is to late.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.77.option1;Kazuk!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.78.desc;Your enemy easily dispatches you of your sword, sending it far away from your grasp. You try to duck and avoid your enemy's deadly swings but it is still just a matter of time before he hits.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.78.option1;Save me Grimnir!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.79.desc;Just as the enemy is going to finish off the Dwarf you throw your axe, cleaving its skull in two. You walk forward and see [From.GetTitledName] laying on the ground covered in blood but still alive.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.79.option1;You can thank me later.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.80.desc;Just as the enemy is going to finish you off, a sudden blur comes from behind your enemy and the enemy's head gets cleaved in two making the headless body tumble down to the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.80.option1;Thank you [From.GetTitledName], for saving me!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.81.desc;You and another Dwarf are humorously bickering about who has shot the most enemies. The competing nature of your relation has made both of you shoot with precision and speed that you could only dream of before.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.81.option1;We should do that again some time!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.83.desc;You fight back to back with another longbeard with dead enemies left and right as the result. Few enemies can stand in your way and you feel more alive than ever before!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.83.option1;KAZUUUUUK!!!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.85.desc;Your hammer leaves a trail of blood and bones in its wake, leaving no enemies in your path unscathed. Your allies join you in your bloodlust rally with undenied fervor against your enemies.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.85.option1;Feel my wrath!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.86.desc;You have joined the table with some old Dwarf veterans and they are all busy boasting about what enemies they have killed and it doesn't take long before you join them in their boasting.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.86.option1;I am the best fighter ever known!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.87.desc;You are now old enough to call yourself an adult, leaving your time as a beardling behind you.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.87.option1;I am free!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88a.desc;At the training field you see a Dwarf firing with his crossbow. You can't help yourself from showing your contempt openly and the Dwarf soon sees you and sneezes.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88b.desc;At the training field you see a Dwarf firing with his handgun. You can't help yourself from showing your contempt openly and the Dwarf soon sees you and sneezes.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88.option1;How can anyone ever want to use that awful weapon?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88.option2;It is not worth fighting for;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.89a.desc;In the middle of your aiming practice with your handgun you notice how [From.GetName] contemptuously watches you from afar. You can feel the anger brewing within you.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.89b.desc;In the middle of your aiming practice with your crossbow you notice how [From.GetName] contemptuously watches you from afar. You can feel the anger brewing within you.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.89.option1;Idiot;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.90a.desc;Your son [From.GetName] has not become a quarreller as he is expected to become but instead he has chosen to become one of those despicable thunderers. Will you accept his decision?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.90b.desc;Your son [From.GetName] has not become a thunderer as he is expected to become but instead he has chosen to become one of those despicable quarrellers. Will you accept his decision?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.90.option2;I accept your decision, even though I do not approve of it.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.90.option1;You are not my son anymore!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.91.desc;I accept your decision, even though I do not approve of it.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.92.desc;HOW DARE YOU DEFY ME! You are not my son anymore!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.92.option1;I am in charge of my destiny, not you!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.94.desc;After your heated discussion a couple of days ago with your son [From.GetFirstName] he has suddenly disapeared without informing anyone about his absence. Has he run away?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.94.option1;Oh oh...;;;;;;;;;x

# DAWI
#
EVTDESCDWARF.0;While on a border patrol, a courtier won a great victory against a hostile force. He tore through a number of enemies, like a true Dwarf should!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.0.b;I could have done just as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.1;While patrolling, this courtier's troops encountered many enemies of our hold. Instead of standing to fight, he fled and left his brothers to die! He brought shame on his family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.1.b;Imprison him! His fate shall be decided later.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.2;Underneath every Dwarf hold, there are uncountable caves and tunnels, holding forgotten secrets. Will you join the tunnel fighters and explore them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.2.a;Time to go tunneling!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.3;Whatever the cause, you were maimed by forces from below. The tunnelers, seeing you as a threat and a burden, lead you back home. No more tunneling for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOPTDWARF.3.a;Ah, well. I brought honour to my clan nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;xx;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.4;You have been underground for a long time now and amassed great wealth in the meantime. Perhaps it is time to rest for now, before your luck runs out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.4.a;Yes, time to go home and see to my wealth...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.5;Do you wish to stop searching the tunnels, and return to your home?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.6;While searching the tunnels, your group happens upon an unknown opening in the wall. Do you want to look into it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.6.a;We won't get rich as cowards! On we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.7;As you delve into the tunnel, you see some new ore deposits. As proof, you grab some nuggets and mark the location on your map.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.8;As you delve into the depths, you keep looking for something worthwhile. Suddenly, you hear warning calls from behind - It's a dead end, and a trap! You will have to fight to get out of there!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.9;Suddenly, wild screams echo through the tunnels. A horde of Night Goblins descends upon your crew! What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.9.a;Jump into the fray! There is no honour for cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.9.b;Better leave that to the professionals...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.10;You join into the shield wall of the other fighters, and soon the Night Goblins are upon you! Strength and discipline against fury and masses...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.10.a;For Grimnir, and our Ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.11;You are not as experienced as the others, and you are aware of it. You decide to leave these ones to them, and stay behind the shield wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.11.a;Good job, you guys! Let them have it, and get us out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.12;You and the others fight on, but in the end, there are just too many Goblins. They are EVERYWHERE, and your group tries to fall back...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.12.a;We have to survive this! Fall back!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.13;In the end, they are still just Goblins. Your group easily takes down a few dozen, and the rest run for their lives. In the end, you killed most of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.13.a;Hah! That was nothing. You should see me when I'm serious...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.14;While searching the tunnels, your men come upon an ancient structure of your kin. They are wary of searching it, fearing ambushes or other threats. What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.14.a;Go ahead and enter the place myself. We have to find out what this was for!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.14.b;Leave this be. We do not want to disturb anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.15;You enter the unknown building, but don't recognize anything. Kicking open one door, you find the sarcophagus of another Dwarf. You just desecrated a tomb!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.16;As you enter the building, you recognize some of the runes on the entrance. And the engravings on the inside. This is an old shrine of Grungni! You immediately begin a prayer, and then search for relics of old to take home, to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.16.a;We have truly been blessed by him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.17;You have been wounded, and can no longer carry on searching the tunnels with the others. It is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# DAWI UNIFICATION

dwarfunification0desc;You have taken some time to look at things, and realized that the High Kingdom needs a new push to reunite. You're both known and renowned enough to give that push and be elected by a council of kings as the new High king. Will you call the others to your court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dwarfunification1desc;The messengers quickly reach every hold that the Dwarfs still maintain - A Hold King called for a Council of Kings, something not done in centuries, to elect a new, proper High King. The other kings at least humour the meeting, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification2desc;This Dwarf, renowned and powerful from what you heard, has called a Council of Kings and declared his High Kingship true and the old line powerless. Do you assist this claimant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification2A;Yes, let the holds stand united once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification2B;No, I'll never accept this beardling as my King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification3desc;You have sworn to serve the new High King, and therefore, the old kingship is of no importance anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification4desc;My High King, I declare your word as truthful and accept your declaration of High Kingship. Let Karak Ankor reunite and the enemies of our clans tremble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification4A;Well said. Have an Ale, and slay the Greenskins!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification5desc;You declare your unwillingness to serve a usurper High King, but many of your clan aren't entirely with you on that...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification5A;Bah, let them grumble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification6desc;I will never willingly serve you, Pretender-King! Son of a Grobi Shaman and a She-troll! Come and face us, if you dare...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification6A;Well, we'll see how he fares alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification7desc;Word spreads around the world quickly - a Dwarf proclaimed his right to rule as the High King, and the other Dwarfs are gathering to agree or reject his terms. A new age for the Dwarfs might dawn...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification6A;Well, we'll see how he fares alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification10desc;Shamefully the vote did not go as you'd have hoped, your fellow dwarves did not have same faith as you did with [From.GetDynName] to rule the dwarven race;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification10a;Wazzoks! truly a shame...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification12_desc;The Council of Kings has concluded and the votes counted, with Total of [Root.sides_with_candidate.GetValue] in favor of the Candidate;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dwarfengineering.2;You show a lot of promise in learning new things. You even got invited to learn from the Engineers in Zhufbar. What do you answer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfengineering2A;Who would disagree with that offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfengineering2B;No, my clan needs me here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfengineering.3;Your child was just invited into the great Engineers Guild of Zhufbar, to learn the craft of engineering. A great honour for the clan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.2;The thrice-cursed [From.GetBestName] has overcome us in battle through trickery and dishonourable tactics. This is an offense Clan [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] won't forget or forgive, and so, a new Grudge is written in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s Book of Grudges...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_dwarfs.2;One more Grudge to avenge...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.3;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has declared a Grudge against [FromFrom.GetBestName]. As kin to Clan [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], Dwarf Lore and Law oblige you to uphold and, if needed to, settle that Grudge.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_dwarfs.3;It is a mater of honour!;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.4;You open [Root.Capital.GetName]'s Book of Grudges. Inside the ancient pages of this dusty tome are listed all the grudges and grievances against Clan [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], yet to be settled...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.6;By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], justice is served!

EVTOPTADR_dwarfs.7;I will take the Slayer Vow;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBDR_dwarfs.7;I would rather live on as an oathbreaker!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.8;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has chosen to take the Slayer Vow due to an unspeakable dishonour. As [From.GetHerHis] legal heir, the rule of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] passes onto you;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hashut_sac;Your guards bring [From.GetTitledFirstName] up the stairs of the temple, towards to a great, brazen statue of Hashut at it's highest point, which has a pool of liquid, molten metal beneath it that acts as a furnace. As the temple's Bull Centaur places [From.GetHerHim] close to the furnace, you hear the mumblings of a [From.Religion.GetName] prayer to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nThe Bull Centaur looks to you, his sturdy skin, blessed by Hashut, unaffected by the extreme heat that comes off the statue's furnace. With a nod from you, he will throw the sacrifice into the furnace...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_sac_dwarf;Mighty Hashut, we offer you this traitor pig, a servant of the Ancestor Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hashut_boons;"You enter [Root.Location.GetName]'s temple ritual room, and the acolytes prepare the altar for your audience with Lord Hashut by plunging a couple of slaves into the temple's furnace, as the ritual follows, you kneel and prostrate 3 times before a great statue of the Bullfather, glowing red-hot due to the burning coals inside it. Choking smoke inundates the chamber and you hear a booming, metallic voice, coming from all places in the room and none:\nASK FOR THY REWARD, MY SERVANT...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_bless_me;Great Hashut, grant me the Gift of Infernal Fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sorcerer;"As you enter the ritual chamber, at the tip of [Root.Location.GetName]'s greatest ziggurat-temple, you notice that the acolytes have prepared everything for your great ceremony of ascension into a Sorcerer-Prophet of Hashut. A hundred slaves, the best specimens from your pits, have been brought as offerings to the Bullfather.\nOne by one, all the slaves are dropped into the fiery pools of molten metal underneath the effigy of Hashut by the temple's Bull Centaurs. The acolytes, enthralled, start singing dirges to Hashut:\nO Bullfather, this sacrifice which we now slay upon Your altar!\nRejoice, drink of its slave blood and feast on its slave flesh!\nMay Your fire and smoke be content to offer naught but power!\n\nYou move towards the altar before the brazen idol, and raise your hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_grant_me;ALL FOR HASHUT!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sorcerer_succeed;"As the cavernous sound of the acolytes' dirges wanes, a chocking cloud of ash and smoke fills the room. A powerful voice resonates from the brazen idol's head:\nLET THIS BE A TESTAMENT OF HASHUT'S MIGHT, THIS SERVANT HAS NOW BEEN GRANTED POWER TO SUBJUGATE THE WINDS OF MAGIC IN MY NAME!\n All Chaos Dwarfs in the room prostrate before these words, and you follow example. You feel a new power stirring inside you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sorcerer_fail;As the cavernous sound of the acolytes' dirges wanes, a chocking cloud of ash and smoke fills the room... you a strange sensation in goes through your body. Is this Hashut's greatest gift? As you search yourself for any changes, you notice that your feet don't move any more... they have turned into stones. As the curse quickly creeps through the rest of your body, you can only hear a booming, metalling laughter before you're fully entrapped into stone...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCAsorcererscurse;You have noticed that as of late, your feet and hands, starting from your toes and fingers, have started to petrify into black stone.

EVTDESCBsorcererscurse;The Sorcerer's Curse has almost completely claimed your body. You the entirety of your lower body has petrified into black stone, and you can barely move your arms. Though you can still talk and think with clarity, it's obvious to everyone that you're no longer fit to rule, and many of your servants see you as weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCsorcererscurse;As your head is completely petrified into black stone you compose a stern expression, knowing that your body will become a testament to Hashut's power, littering the highways to Zharr-Naggrund next to the petrified bodies of the other Sorcerer-Prophets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCchaos_dwarf_buy_hellcannons;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a [From.Culture.GetName] from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has come to [Root.Capital.GetName] seeking to purchase a regiment of mighty Doomcanon infernal engines from our factories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_sell_weapons;Very well! Get those armaments ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_sell_hellcannons;Very well! Get those Doomcannons ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPB_chaos_dwarf_sell_nothing;No! I won't sell anything to a filthy [From.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment;Now that you've decided what to purchase from [From.Capital.GetName]'s factories, you have to pay the price for it. The Chaos Dwarfs accept payments in gold or slaves. If you wish to pay in slaves, you'll need to either give them slaves from your own pits or some inhabitants of your capital province.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_money;I will pay in gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_slaves;I will pay in slaves from my own pits!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_money;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to pay in gold. While it isn't a payment as good as slaves would have been, it's still good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_slaves;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to pay you in slaves from [From.GetHerHis] pits. The slaves appear to be weary, having been taken from many lands and races, but are still in good condition to work in our factories or serve in our hosts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_own_slaves;Amusingly enough, [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has decided to chain [From.GetHerHis] own people in [From.Capital.GetName] and send them to you as slaves! The [From.Culture.GetName] slaves appear to be in a decent condition, enough to work in our factories or serve in our hosts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_money;It is enough indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_slaves;A thousand slaves for our toil!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Mighty infernal engines of terrible destructive power, the Doomcannons are accompanied by a small regiment of Chaos Dwarf Hellforge Guards, to ensure that the demons trapped inside the engines don't turn them against their masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_weapons_arrived;The Chaos weapons and armour you bought from [From.GetTitledFirstName] have finally arrived at [Root.Capital.GetName]! Your warriors are starting to arm themselves with these powerful items... their strength will surely be incremented a thousandfold!.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus;Most of the Great Tauruses in the plains of Zharrduk come from the breeding pens under the temple of Hashut in Zharr-Naggrund. While most of the beasts there are fully grown, it takes time for the Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers to attune the beast's binding enchantments to a new rider. These rituals will be completed in 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus;Outside of the plains of Zharrduk, the Great Tauruses can only be found in their natural habitats, inside the calderas of active volcanoes. You have managed to convince one of the Bull Centaurs guarding [From.Capital.GetName]'s temple to snatch a young calf from one of the nearby volcanoes. The beast will be fully grown and magically bound in 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus_trained;Finally, the Great Taurus is tamed, the magical beast's binding enchantments fully attuned so that it obeys your will completely. The Great Tauruses are considered by the Chaos Dwarfs to be the living images of Hashut, great, winged bulls surrounded by a wreathing aura of infernal flame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus_trained;On wings of fire and smoke I soar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_lamassu;Only the Sorcerer-Prophets of Hashut have the magical prowess to master a Lammasu as their mount. But these beasts cannot be binded by magic alone, like the Great Tauruses. Lammasus are cunning, intelligent beasts, and must as well be bargained within order to be completely mastered, for not even the Dawi Zharr would dare mount a Lammasu without pacting with it before. The process to find, convince and master a Lammasu will take 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_lamassu;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_lamassu_trained;Finally, the Lammasu has been brought down to your service, through equal parts of deceit and magical skill. The Lammasus are beasts of insidious cunning, resembling Great Tauruses in it's bovine body, leathery wings and back quarters, but with clawed forelimbs and an eerie bearded, and horned face, resembling a Chaos Dwarf in many ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_lamassu_trained;Hashut favours me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPCchaosdwarf_slave_raid;Take them as slaves, and burn this land!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBchaosdwarf_slave_raid;The province of [From.GetName] has been raided and burned to the ground by our great hosts. Most of your overseers are on their way to [Root.Capital.GetName], herding the slaves you previously captured in another assault, but your personal entourage can still herd a small quantity of them...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_must_sacrifice;For too long have the furnaces at [Root.Capital.GetName] remained silent and devoid of any kind of offering. You have gone 4 years without a proper sacrifice to Hashut. The Father of Darkness does not look kindly upon those who fail to pay Him tribute...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_chaos_dwarf_must_sacrifice;I'm sure the Bullfather doesn't mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice;The acolytes of Hashut have prepared the furnaces at the top of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s ziggurat for your grand sacrifice ceremony by chanting the sacred dirges. Now is the time, to offer the souls of slaves and wretches to the Bullfather, so that our Lord Hashut may feast on them.\n\nThe temple's Bull Centaurs look to you with anticipation, ready to retrieve the next sacrifice at your command...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hashut_great_sacrifice;Herd in slaves from the factories!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_hashut_great_sacrifice;Bring the wretches that form our slave levies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_hashut_great_sacrifice;Our prisoners shall have the honour to become sacrifice!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_hashut_great_sacrifice;I've changed my mind! Hashut doesn't deserve any gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_prisoner;Your watch gleefully as the Bull Centaurs drag [From.GetTitledFirstName] up the stairs of the ziggurat, towards the great, brazen statue of Hashut, a pool of molten metal beneath it acts as it's furnace. As the Bull Centaur places [From.GetHerHim] close to the furnace, you hear the mumblings of a prayer to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\n[From.GetFirstName] tries to keep a stoic composure... but it soon fades into agony as [From.GetSheHe] is submerged into the molten metal...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_character_blessing;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you feel that your body is now strong as a Bull Centaur's and your mind is quick as a Daemon's... certainly, you have been blessed by the Bullfather!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_province_blessing;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you don't notice any changes, at first, but when you step out of the Zigurrat's ceremonal changer you notice that your whole land has been covered in a thick, red smoke which seems to be unnaturally empowering your forges and slaves, certainly [Root.Capital.GetName] has been blessed by the Bullfather!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_bull_centaurs_join;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you don't see any changes, at first, but when you step out of the Zigurrat's ceremonal changer you notice that a small regiment of Bull Centaurs is waiting at it's feet, willing to serve you! Clearly, this is Father Hashut's providence gracing us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_hashut_angry;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you notice a cloud of red smoke forming in front of you, in a wink, it quickly files towards you and forces itself down your throat, making you pass out... when you awake, you're informed by the temple's Acolytes that you must have somehow earned Hashut's wrath, and indeed, you feel much weaker...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_great_sacrifice_hashut_angry;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_slaves;Your watch gleefully as the Bull Centaurs herd in masses of slaves up the stairs of the ziggurat, towards the great, brazen statue of Hashut, a pool of molten metal beneath it acts as it's furnace. As the Bull Centaur places them close to the furnace, you hear multiple mumbles and whimpers coming from the wretches.\n\nThey're pushed one by one into the pool of molten metal, their anguished laments forming a wonderful choir...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_great_sacrifice_slaves;Mighty Hashut! Accept the slave blood and slave flesh we offer thee!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CD_factory_decays;The slave population in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s factories has recently declined due to chocking smoke, factory accidents, famine and general mismanagement;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CD_factory_decays;Hashut's cock! Well, we'll have to get more slaves...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CD_slave_levy_decays;The population in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s slave barracks has recently declined due to chocking smoke, incompetent hobgoblin overseers, famine and general mismanagement;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CD_slave_levy_decays;Hashut's cock! Well, we'll have to get more slaves...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf.41;The Bullfather is pleased with your offering. As your sacrifice dissolves into the molten metal pit, you hear a booming voice coming from the brazen idol's head...offering you gifts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf.41;Grant me some of your fiery K'daai servants, to sear my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBDR_chaos_dwarf.41;Mighty Hashut, bless me with your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCDR_chaos_dwarf.41;Great Hashut, touch my lands with your fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDDR_chaos_dwarf.41;Bullfather, grant me greater dominion over the Winds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf.42;The Bullfather must be pleased with you, for after your sacrifice dissolves into the molten pit, a daemonic creature of fire and steel surges from it, pledging itself to your service;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf.42;Bend to my will, daemon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf43;As your sacrifice sinks into the molten metal, you hear a bellowing in the outside. Hashut has sent you a Great Taurus, one of his most favoured creatures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf43;I will soar on wings of fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf44;The Bullfather is pleased. You watch as the molten metal takes into different shapes and forms... showing images of yourself surrounded by power and riches!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf44;It will all be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf45;As the sacrifice sinks into the molten pit you hear the booming voice of Hashut in your head, praising you... His greatest son!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf45;All will bow before me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf46;After the sacrifice sinks into the molten metal pit, you receive visions of yourself... a crown of fire is on your brows, burning... burning, until naught but ash remains...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf46;Why? What is the meaning of this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf47;As the sacrifice sinks into the molten pit you get closer to it, in order to receive your gift... when suddenly a gush of molten metal sprays you in the face;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf47;AAAAGH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf48;At last the sacrifice dissolves into the molten pit of metal... and the ritual room is filled with a most dire silence. It seems that the Bullfather has ignored your offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf48;Hashut's balls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf49;Praise Mighty Hashut! After all the sacrifices and absolute servitude, the Bullfather has finally granted you His greatest of gifts: dominion over the Winds of Magic! Soon the whole world will be under your yoke, for now, you're one of the great, magnificent masters of the Dawi Zharr, a Sorcerer-Prophet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf49;ALL FOR HASHUT!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf_kdaai_summoned;The K'daai slowly takes form before you, a creature of magma and iron, half-daemon and half-raging fire. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf_kdaai_summoned;I am your Master now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf_kdaai_summoned_else;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a searing K'daai to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# LAHMIAN EVENTS
#
lahmia0desc;You are the Queen of the Lahmians. Your ancient kingdom of Lahmia in Nehekhara was taken from you, but its glories of old can still be restored. Using stealth, cunning, and seduction you can mould the world of men to serve your purposes. Send your daughters into the world, have them infiltrate the corridors of power, and when the time is right - have your mortal puppets dance to the tune that you play for them. Seduce the weak mortals to become your slaves and then one day you shall lead a great army to retake Lahmia and you shall live forever as its queen, with nothing in the world being denied to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia0A;So let it be written, so let it be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia1desc;You have decided to seduce this target personally. He will have no choice but to ultimately become your slave, and do all that you require of him...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia1A;I'll need to pack... slaves! Ready my baggage-train!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia5desc;You have chosen this man to focus your efforts on. You will have to send one of your dynasty to accomplish the task, only they are skilled enough to even attempt to seduce a powerful man like this. (Note: Wait a week between each assignment);;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia5A;I will send this one;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia5B;I will send an elite member of the Sisterhood;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia6desc;Your mother has instructed you to seduce a target, and bend him to the will of the Sisterhood. You must leave immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia6A;I shall pack my best outfits, perfumes, and jewels immediately, my Queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia8desc;You are in the lands of your target. Now... what shall we do...;;;;;;;;;;;;x ;
lahmia8A;I will play the damsel in distress...;;;;;;;;;;;;x ;
lahmia8B;I will host a lavish ball, as the rich new heiress in town;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia8C;With his wife dead, he will need some comforting...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia8D;I will host a lavish ball, as the rich new heiress in town;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia9desc;Your daughter sends word - she has reached her destination safely, and will begin infiltrating the court as ordered and bend its ruler to your will.;;;;;;;;;;;;x ;
lahmia9A;Mmm... good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia10desc;One morning while falconing, you hear a lady scream in the distance. She sounds like she is in serious trouble! You look around, and your companions are nowhere to be seen. What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia10A;I shall rescue the lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia10B;If she's in trouble, I could be in danger. Ride for home at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia11desc;You hear your target is going falconing, and have had your handmaidens ensure that his companions would be... distracted. Once you see him alone in the distance, you give the signal, and three hired ruffians pretend to attack you as you let out an ear-piercing scream of terror! Just as expected, your target comes riding full force with his sword drawn just when the ruffians throw you to the ground. Seeing him, they scatter in all directions, and he jumps off his horse, asking if you are unhurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia11A;Oh, my brave lord! You saved my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia12desc;You hear your target is going falconing, and have had your handmaidens ensure that his companions would be... distracted. Once you see him alone in the distance, you give the signal, and three hired ruffians pretend to attack you as you let out an ear-piercing scream of terror! You see your intended staring, hesitating, even as the ruffians throw you to the ground and act like they are about to take you. Then the coward turns and rides away at full speed! Useless, weak, and thrice-cursed mortal fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia12A;*hiss* I'll need time to come up with a new plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia13desc;As you rush towards them with your sword drawn, the ruffians quickly scatter. The lady is beautiful, and judging from her torn clothes and jewels, very rich. She thanks you profusely, and you escort her back to the city. Upon arrival she takes her leave, but promises that she will repay you for your gallantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia13A;What a stunning beauty. I'm a hero for saving her!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BANQUET;A Great Ball;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14desc;You play the part of the noble damsel in distress perfectly, allowing him to see himself as your saviour and protector as he escorts you back to the city. Upon arriving at the market, you take your leave, but promise to reward him for his virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14A;Now I will invite him to a ball...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14B;I should get rid of his wife first...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14C;I'll sneak into his room at night...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14D;Unfortunately, this game ends. I must return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15desc;Word around the city is that a rich heiress is hosting a magnificent gala, and of course your invitation arrived just this morning in gold-stamped letters. Rumours say that she is as beautiful as she is rich. Do you want to attend?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15A;Why yes, of course! Next Friday? Certainly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15B;Oh, it's the lady I saved while falconing! Of course I'll attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15C;No, I have no interest in balls or heiresses;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia16desc;Tonight is the night of the ball you are hosting. Everything has been prepared to an exquisite detail, and you are the centre of attention and envy in the room. Finally, your prize guest arrives and the evening proceeds down to the minutest detail of your desires. The music is playing, the nobles are dancing, and the wine flows. You dance with your guest of honour, and work your arts of seduction on him subtly. As the evening draws to a close, it is time to make your move...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia16A;Whisper in his ear and suggest he stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia16B;Poison his wife, his grief will make him vulnerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17desc;Tonight is the night of the grand gala. You arrive to a splendid mansion and are greeted by the beautiful - and obviously fabulously wealthy - heiress. As the wine flows and the music plays, you find your eyes inexplicably drawn towards her, and you often find her smiling seductively back at you from across the room. As the evening draws to a close, the last dance is called, and she glides over and takes you to the floor. After a flawlessly executed dance, she whispers hotly in your ear 'Care to stay the night, my lord?';;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17A;*whisper back* I'll return when the guests have left...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17B;But... I'm married! I can't!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17C;No, that would not be proper, my lady. Good night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LAHMIA_LOVERS;Lovers;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LAHMIA_SEDUCTION;Seduction;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRIEF;Grief;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia18descA;You seduce your target into a night of wild passion, and as dawn is about to break, you know that for the moment at least - he is under your spell. While he remains so, you can use your influence once a year to get him to send you expensive gifts, or even troops on some pretext that your distant family lands are under threat from greenskins or even other vampires. Should you leave him to return to your own lands, however, your hold over him will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia18descB;You seduce your target into a night of wild passion, and as dawn is about to break, you know that for the moment at least - he is under your spell. While he remains so, you can use your influence once a year to get him to send you expensive gifts, or even troops on some pretext that your distant family lands are under threat from greenskins or even other vampires. You will then pass these on to your queen, to further the cause of restoring ancient Lahmia to the sisterhood. Should you leave him to return to your own lands, however, your hold over him will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia18A;I knew he would not resist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia19desc;You have spent a night of wild passion with this beautiful and mysterious lady, and you are certain that you'll be seeing more of her in the months and years to come. You have scratch and bite marks all over your body, and though it hurts to get dressed, you leave with a smile on your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia19A;Until next time, mysterious lady.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia21desc;Cruel fate! Your wife suddenly took ill, and died screaming in the night. It happened so soon... but the doctors could find no trace of poison, and who would have any motive?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia21A;Why, gods, why?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia21B;These are perilous times...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia22desc;Hah! The mark's wife died 'suddenly and tragically'... what a shame... and from my spies in the court, no one knows why. Those servant boys I seduced did very well indeed. That's one obstacle removed. Now... to proceed with the plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia22A;Yes, what shall be the next step?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia23desc;A plot to poison your wife has been revealed! When put to the question, the servants who were caught with the poison revealed everything - a beautiful rich heiress seduced them to do the dark deed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia23A;I want this 'heiress' seized and executed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia24desc;Damnations! Those foolish servant boys you seduced got themselves caught trying to poison your target's wife, and your sources in the court say that they spoke your name. This cat and mouse game is over. Time to flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia24A;I only hope my mistress will forgive my failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia24B;I can't believe I failed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia26desc;Cruel fate! As you wake up the next day, your wife lies dead next to you. It happened so soon and so quietly... but the doctors could find no trace of poison, and who would have any motive?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia26A;Curses! Why gods, why?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia26B;These are perilous times...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia27desc;You manage to dump poison from your ring into the cup of your target's wife, just as the final toast is made. From reports, she died quietly in her sleep in the night, and the cause remains a mystery. That's one obstacle removed. Now... to proceed with the plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia27A;Yes, what shall be the next step?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia28desc;Your wife has been poisoned, but due to the quick actions of a priest she was saved in time! It must have happened during the feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia28A;I want all who attended questioned immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia29desc;Damnations! Your sources inside the court reveal to you that the place is in an uproar. Her life was saved by a holy priest, but they are going to conduct a thorough investigation of everyone who attended the feast. As a vampire, you cannot pass such close examination... This cat and mouse game is over. Time to flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia29A;I only hope my mistress will forgive my failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia29B;I can't believe I failed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia30desc;The shock of your wife's death still haunts you, but your new lady acquaintance has been a great help and comfort. You find yourself thinking about her all the time. Perhaps, it would not be wrong to let this go a little further?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia30A;Yes, surely it was meant to be!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia30B;No. There is something 'off' about her...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia31desc;You have played the role of a trusted friend to your mark since his wife's death, and one night after a lot of wine he moves in to kiss you. Hah - your skills of seduction are as strong as ever, he never had a chance...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia31A;All men are weak, if you only know which buttons to push.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia32desc;Despite trying your best to seduce your mark, it seems you have failed! He is no longer answering your letters, and the guards at the gates will not admit you to his presence any more. It seems you must return home and give up on this chase...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia32A;Curses;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia33desc;Your mark refuses to take the bait, and has sent word that he will not attend your ball. Your attempts to get in further contact with him have all failed. It seems you must give up on this chase... it's time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia33A;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia34desc;Your mark looks at you with shock when you offer him to stay the night, and coldly informs you that that would not be proper. He leaves in a hurry, and all attempts at further contact fails. It seems this chase is over... it's time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia34A;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmiadeadtarget;Your mark is dead. It's time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50desc;You have continued to infiltrate the layers of high society around your mark, hosting lavish midnight balls and creating your own network of spies where your handmaidens manipulate and seduce the lesser actors in this game while you set the tune to which they dance. Your mark is in the palm of your hand, he will not refuse you anything. What shall you ask for? Perhaps your funds are tied up in a business venture and you need some gold to maintain your lifestyle? Or perhaps your dear fictional friend or relative has lands under threat, and could use some soldiers to help her out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50C;I must return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50A;Manipulate him into giving you gold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50B;Manipulate him into giving you troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia51desc;While attending one of her lavish midnight balls, your dear friend, looking stunning as ever, asks to speak to you privately. She looks distraught and on the verge of tears. It seems her steward has tied her money up in a risky business venture, and she fears she cannot maintain her estate at all if she cannot find the funds elsewhere. She would be humiliated, thrown out of her home, and forced to live like a commoner. She looks at you appealingly, and asks if you can do anything to help her out of her predicament?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia51A;My dear lady, let it trouble you no longer. I will help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia51B;No, I won't help with money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia52desc;Your benefactor agrees to support your lifestyle with his own funds until yours are once more liquid, and you make sure he is well rewarded for his generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia52A;This game continues to delight! Now I'll send these to my queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia52B;This game continues to delight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia53desc;Your dear lady friend is delighted, and you are richly rewarded for your generosity over the coming days and weeks. You are pleased with yourself, as the city would be such a dull place without her stunning beauty, lavish parties and clever wit. She really is the centre of high society in many ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia53A;I couldn't let such a noble lady live like a commoner...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia54desc;Curses! Your mark is apparently not so easily manipulated... he refuses to help you with money, which makes him useless to you. All this work wasted... it is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia54A;That arrogant mortal, I should rip his throat out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia55desc;You refuse to help out the heiress with money, and despite her pleas, you leave the ball without helping her. The next day, you are informed that she has packed up and left the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia55A;Shame. I think I'll miss her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia56desc;While attending one of her lavish balls, your dear friend, looking stunning as ever, asks to speak to you privately. She looks distraught and on the verge of tears. It seems a dear elderly aunt has lands that are under threat, and she doesn't know what to do to help. She looks at you appealingly, and asks that if you are powerful enough to send some troops to her aid?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia56A;I will outfit an expedition immediately to clear her lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia56B;No, I won't help with troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia57desc;Your benefactor agrees to send troops to your endangered relative, and you make sure he is well rewarded for his generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia57A;This game continues to delight! Now I'll send these to my queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia57B;This game continues to delight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia58desc;Your dear lady friend is delighted, and you are richly rewarded for your generosity over the coming days and weeks. You are pleased with yourself, as the city would be such a dull place without her stunning beauty, lavish parties and clever wit. She really is the centre of high society in many ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia58A;I couldn't let such a noble lady be distraught;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia59desc;Curses! Your mark is apparently not so easily manipulated... he refuses to help you with troops, which makes him useless to you. All this work wasted... it is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia59A;That arrogant mortal, I should rip his throat out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia60desc;You refuse to help out the heiress with troops, and despite her pleas, you leave the ball without helping her. The next day, you are informed that she has packed up and left the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia60A;Shame. I think I'll miss her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia100desc;My Queen, I have failed you. The mark resisted attempts at seduction, and would be of no help in gaining us either gold or troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia100A;Failure is not an option, my dear...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia100B;You disappoint me, dear daughter;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia101desc;My Queen, the mark has died. There is nothing more for me to do here... I shall return home immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia101A;These mortals... such frail and brief lives...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia102desc;My Queen, I send you these gifts. I succeeded in manipulating my mark into giving me some gold to maintain my lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia102A;Well done, daughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia102B;Well done, daughter. Return home when you are able.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia103desc;My Queen, I send you these troops. I succeeded in manipulating my mark into giving me some to protect my dear elderly relative... I trust you will soon have them turned into loyal servants of the sisterhood shortly after they arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia103A;Well done, daughter. We look forward to breaking them in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia103B;Well done, daughter. Return home when you are able.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia200desc;One night alone with your lover she smiles darkly at you, revealing sharp fangs, and grasps you with supernatural strength to prevent you from running. She is a vampire! Who could have possibly predicted this turn of events? She wants you to come with her to the Lahmian Court, where you may be granted life eternal, and great power... do you dare refuse?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia200A;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia200B;Eternal life and power you say? Why of course, my love...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia202desc;One night alone with your mortal plaything you smile darkly at him, revealing sharp fangs, and pin him down to prevent him from running. You ask him to join you at the Lahmian Court, where he may be granted life eternal, and great power... after the shock subsides, you see that he will do as instructed. The promise of power and an eternity of delights has swayed his weak mind, and you can now do with him as you wish. His bizarre disappearance means he is disinherited from his family forever now, but if he has any claims, you can press them forcefully in war if you so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia202A;Excellent...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia203desc;One night alone with your mortal plaything you smile darkly at him, revealing sharp fangs, and pin him down to prevent him from running. You ask him to join you at the Lahmian Court, where he may be granted life eternal, and great power... after the shock subsides, you see that he will not do as instructed. He tries to pull away from you and screams for the guards - what do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia203A;Attack him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia203B;*hiss* Weak fool! *jump out the window and make a run for it*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia204desc;You think you have found a mark... she is reputedly both beautiful and highly skilled in the arts of intrigue. She might make a fine addition to the sisterhood. Shall you seek her out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia204A;Yes, by all means;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia205desc;doesnt really matter, only for unlanded AIs. But she gets the offer to join the lahmians, thats the gist;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia205A;Yes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia205B;No;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia206desc;Through a mixture of seduction, intimidation, and just perfectly set up circumstances, you convince your mark to accept the blood kiss and join the Lahmian sisterhood. Your queen will be very pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia207desc;Despite your best efforts, you fail at getting close enough to your mark to give her the blood kiss. Curses! All that time wasted... but she was too well guarded, there was no sense in risking your life just to turn her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia207A;There will be other marks...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia208desc;Your [GetFromRelation] has run off it seems, leaving her home and family. Why would she do something like this, what could have possibly enticed her to give up everything she had?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia208A;Scandalous... she is cut off!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia208B;Poor girl, she had so much potential.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia209desc;One day you wake up alone, with a note on your wife's pillow. It coldly informs you that she is leaving you, and that she does not want you to look for her or think of her any more. 'All we have is dead, as I am dead. Marry another.', it ends with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia209A;Thrice cursed harlot! She has humiliated me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia210desc;My Queen, I have sired a new Lahmian progeny. She is both beautiful and highly skilled. I trust that she will make us proud, and serve the sisterhood well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia210A;Well done. You are a good minion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia302desc;One of your holdings in the realms of men has sent you their bi-annual profits. Whether from prostitution, blackmail, assassinations or simple corrupt business deals, they have managed to turn a tidy profit it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia302A;Well done, sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia302B;Do not bother me with this again. Just send the cash.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia303desc;There have been strange things happening in this province. The temple suspects a hidden group of vampires, and these must be rooted out with fire and sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia303A;Our faith will prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia303B;No, it's probably nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia304desc;You have survived the efforts of the vampires to stop you, and now that you know they are here, the infestation is rooted out with fire, stakes, and cold silver.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia304A;Our faith prevails again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia305desc;One of your holdings has been destroyed by the Witch Hunters. Perhaps it is time to appoint some better protectors? It is their job to prevent these things from happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia305A;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia305B;Do not bother me with such bad news again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
witchhunter40desc;Your top liege is a servant of the gods, and will not tolerate you in his realm. It is better to flee now, rather than to risk destruction at the hands of the Witch Hunters...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
witchhunter40A;Agreed, I must leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction0desc;A foolish mortal has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but as your desire grows, so does your hunger. One night you can barely restrain yourself from taking your fill of their blood - perhaps it is time to end this little game?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction0A;Yes, I must sate my thirst! *attack your lover*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction0B;No, I will show restraint...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction1desc;You have foolishly decided to take a vampire for your lover. One night, as the passion runs high, a feral look comes over your lover. Sharp fangs snap out and clawed hands hold you down with bestial strength - then all you feel is pain as you are brutally mauled and drained of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction1A;Oh gods, wait! Nooo - not there!!! Get off me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction2desc;You have foolishly decided to take a vampire for your lover. One night, as the passion runs high, a feral look comes over your lover. Sharp fangs snap out and clawed hands hold you down with supernatural strength - then your lover smiles down at you, satisfied for the moment. 'No, you get to live another night...';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction2A;That's it - I'm done with this vampire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction2B;You had me worried there for a second...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction3desc;You feed greedily on your lover, but at the last moment, show some restraint. The pulse is weak, the body is mauled, but somehow, still breathing. You decide to let them live, if they can recover, and tell your minions to take this one back home in their carriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction3A;No sense completely draining good cattle, I always say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction4desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to bestow some of grandfather Nurgle's gifts on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction4A;Yes, feel the embrace of Grandfather Nurgle, my love...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction4B;No, I will show restraint...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction5desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One morning you wake up feeling dizzy and nauseous, and your paramour smiles down at you. 'I have given you a gift... do you like it?';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction5A;*coughs up blood* That's it - we are DONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction5B;I... I do kind of like it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction6desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to show them some of the true pleasures that Slaanesh has to offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction6A;Yes, feel the embrace of Slaanesh, lover...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction7desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One morning you wake up, and as your body burns with pain, you realize that last night was not a nightmare. You are covered in wounds and as you remember tortured fragments of last night's events your lover merely smiles down at you. 'Did you enjoy it, my love?';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction7A;That's it, we are DONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction7B;I... I think I did...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction8desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to see if they are worthy of the Blood God's favour?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction8A;Yes, a test is in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction9desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One day while walking in the woods with your lover, a huge knight approaches, radiating a palpable aura of evil. Your lover smiles. 'Today is the day you must prove yourself to Khorne, my love...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction9A;That's it, we are DONE! *run away as fast as possible*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction9B;Yes... at last. Blood for the Blood God!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction10desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to see how they deal with the Tzeentch's gifts?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction10A;Yes, some warpdust in their wine perhaps...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction11desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One night after drinking some strange-tasting wine, you wake in the middle of the night to terrible pain as your body transforms. Your lover smiles down at you - 'Do not be afraid, this is a gift, a wonderful, wonderful gift...';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction11A;*scream in horror as you feel the mutation* That's it, we are DONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction11B;I... I will embrace the change!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction3B;No, our passion shall be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen7;[From.GetTitledName] has aknowledged [From.GetHerHis] defective thoughts and relinquished lead of this city-temple to a more competent Skink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen7;I sssee...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEslizardmen8;Naggaront Ambush! ( Lizardmen );;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen8;Your long search for ancient artifacts on behalf of your superior has almost cost you your life today, when you've been attacked by a pack of young wild naggaronts, barely escaping along your entourage of Sauri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVOPTAslizardmen8;All ssacrificess are worthy on behalf of the Old Onesss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVOPTBslizardmen8;All ssacrificess are worthy on behalf of the Old Onesss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen9;Old Ones preserve us,\n on our search, we've been caught by the wild beasts which are sacred to our progenitors, but still do not recognize our task in their mindless souls.\n My body has been temporarely incapacitated, but I shall soon retake my duties.\n\n The Old Ones are wise in their design;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen9;I sssee...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen10;Old Ones preserve us,\n on our search, we've been caught by the wild beasts which are sacred to our progenitors, but still do not recognize our task in their mindless souls.\n My body has been permanently incapacitated, and I may not be able to retake my current duties.\n\n The Old Ones are wise in their design;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen10;I sssee...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEslizardmen11;A Fragment is Found ( Lizardmen );;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen11;By the will of the Old Ones, your hard search has finally given its result: you've found a fragment of one of the ancient tablets of the Creators, whose translation will allow the Lizardmen to better fulfill their ultimate task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen11;Praissse the Old Onesss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen12;By the will of the Old Ones, your Chief Explorer has found a fragment of one of the ancient tablets of the Creators, whose translation will allow the Lizardmen to better fulfill their ultimate task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen12;Praissse the Old Onesss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen13;You've defeated the warriors of [From.GetName]. According to the old rituals, all of the prisoners caught fighting in this land are elegible to be worthy sacrifices to the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen13;Pillage all! Take everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen13;We will take only the sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen13;These are not worthy, move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen14;[From.GetFirstName] has raided the province of [FromFrom.GetName], snatching many of the warriors and civilians and leaving nothing but a smoking rubble of many villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen14;Monstrous savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen15;[From.GetFirstName] has raided the province of [FromFrom.GetName], snatching many of the warriors and civilians and leaving nothing but a smoking rubble of many villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen15;Monstrous savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen16;[From.GetFirstName] has raided the province of [FromFrom.GetName]. Although most of the buildings are intact, there is only but a few survivors left to tell of the many screaming prisoners dragged away by [From.GetHerHis] warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen16;Monstrous savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen17;You shamed the Creators: the tribute reaped from your enemies is not sufficient to perform a proper ceremony. Your miscalculation in this war is a clear sign you acted against the perfection of the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen17;The prisoners have been rounded up beneath the great temples of the Old Ones. Whom will you dedicate your sacrifice to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen17;Imposssible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen17;The Great Sssun God Chotec.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen17;The Benevolent Protector Quetzzl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen17;The Myssteriousss Xholankha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEslizardmen17;The Ravenouss Sssotek!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen19;A Mage-Priest died under your care! This cannot be part of the Great Plan, your gross inefficency in the most holy of the tasks shows your being to be defective beyond measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen19;No no no no no no no!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen20;A Mage-Priest died under the care of one of your appointed chiefs! This cannot be part of the Great Plan, the gross inefficency of your helper in the most holy of the tasks shows your being also to be seriously defective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen20;Sssshh.. How could it be!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen21;The other Lizardmen do not understand your motives, they do not understand your behavior, so far it is removed from the Great Plan and the legacy of the Slann. It is common knowledge amongst the Skink that you emerged from your spawning pool somewhat defective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen21;Nonsssensse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22;You boast about your personal accomplishments and crave for more glory at each step of the journey. Too close you associate yourself with what should be the design of the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22;I am jussst overzealouss in my tasskss..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22001;You keep in your place and dulyfully perform your tasks. Truly, you are a productive and gregarious servant, working for the fruition of the Old Ones' Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22001;I belong to the Creatorsss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22002;You keep missing work, underperforming, trying to constantly avoid responsibility. The Creators designed the Skinks to be loyal and productive servants, to behave as irresponsibly as you do is to go against your very nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22002;Jussst a minute to ressst, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22003;You work tirelessly and always crave for more tasks to be completed. Truly, you are a paragon of what it means to be a Skink: productive and efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22003;I work for the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22004;You are always quick to anger, ready to act violently against whatever presents to be an issue to yourself. Such a behavior could be forgivable in a Saurus, but a Skink is not made for violence and such outburst can only hint to some inherent deviance in your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22004;Well, ssscrew YOU!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22005;You always keep a cooler blood than any of your peers and approach all your troubles with a calm and rational mind. Thus is what a Skink should be and you cannot fail to set a great example for all the younger spawns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22005;Good, good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22006;A Skink should always act and speak openly to his spawn siblings. Your honesty and clarity can only quicken the achievement of the Great Plan through cohordinated effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22006;Liess are uselesss in the face of the Old Onesss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22007;Your deceptive nature is a deviance and a frustration for all other Skinks around you. The Old Ones made you to cohoperate and work together, but your deceptions make you unreliable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22007;It isss sstill for the greater good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22008;You like the glittering of gold and to keep such trinkets for yourself, but what does gold matter to the Ancients? Only lesser races, the savage mammals, should find any sort of solance by staring at a shiny useless metal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22008;But.. but.. it'ss sssso pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22009;You find an unhealthy joy in giving away trinkets and resources to those around you, even though the legacy of the Old Ones is neither cheap not to be squandered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22009;Ssshould it be let to wassste?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22010;You rarely know fear and gladly throw yourself in battle, this would be expected from a Saurus, but Skinks are made to be stewards and workers, not warriors. Your lack of fear might cloud your judgement and cause you to rush to a miscalculated action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22010;Doess it matter, if I win?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22011;You trust in the Old Ones and spend all your waking thoughts on how to better serve them and quicken the achievement of the Great Plan. All Skinks look up to you as a paragon of zealotry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22011;The Old Ones are with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22012;Your lack of faith in the design of the Old Ones is abhorrent. Nothing should be more important than understanding and achieving the Great Plan, yet you often find yourself wasting thoughts on other frivolous matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22012;There'sss more to thiss life than the Great Plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen23001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] agrees with your interpretation of the will of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen23002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] disagrees with your interpretation: that's not what [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24;The clerks rush into your hall, screaming in discomfort: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep! What does it MEAN!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24;He wantsss a ritual to be performed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24;He'sss warning usss of a coming threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen24;He wantsss to be moved to a better place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen24;He wantsss hiss neck cleaned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep and concluded the Slann his silently demanding a ritual to be held in the honor of the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep and concluded the Slann his silently warning the Skinks of a coming threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24002;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24002;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep and concluded the Slann his silently demanding to be moved to a better location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24003;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24003;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep and concluded the Slann his silently requesting his neck to be cleaned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24004;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24004;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25;It has been nearly a moon cycle since a swat of flies has been lingering over [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s head, drawing strange forms in the air. Many are know wondering what is the meaning of these flies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25;They're mimicking a constellation we sshould look for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25;They're sshowing the flow of magic around him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen25;He called them to ussse ass magic component!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen25;They're ssucking hiss sweat! Ssshoo them!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the meaning behind some flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head must be linked to one of the sacred constellations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head must be following the Winds of Magic flowing around the sleeping Slann.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25002;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25002;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head must have been summoned there by the Slann for a later use as spell components.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25003;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25003;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head are an annoyance sent by the Ruinous Powers and must be eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25004;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25004;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26;The clerks rush into your hall, screaming in discomfort: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has just started snoring! What does it MEAN!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26;It's a prophecy in the tongue of the Old Onesss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26;He'sss casting a very complicate sspell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen26;The light isss bothering him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen26;He'sss asking for food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s alledged snoring is in fact a prophecy in a long-forgotteng language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s alledged snoring is complex and obscure spell being casted by the collective Slann.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26002;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26002;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s snoring is due to the Slann being bothered by a source of light distracting him from his meditation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26003;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26003;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s snoring is due to the Slann being hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26004;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26004;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen27;You could barely breathe after receiving the sensational news: [From.GetTitledFirstName] just spoke to one of the priests! And he asked for a maggot soup! What does it MEAN!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen27;It'sss a metaphor for ssomething to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen27;He demands a sssacrifice be made in hiss name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen27;Hiss ssskin is dry! Wassh him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen27;He wantss to eat ssome maggot ssoup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen27001;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] just spoke, asking for a maggot soup. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined his words are a methaphor for some obscure future event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen27001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen27001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen27002;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] just spoke, asking for a maggot soup. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined he is demanding a sacrifice to be made in his honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen27002;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen27002;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen27003;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] just spoke, asking for a maggot soup. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined he is complaining for his skin being too dry and demands to be washed and rehidratated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen27003;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen27003;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTTITLEslizardmen29;The Ancient Tablet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29;[From.GetTitledFirstName] awoke for a minute to make clear the will of the Old Ones: the location of one of the ancient artifacts of the time before the fall of the Polar Gates has been found. Even now the foul agents of strife are working to cloud the vision of the Mage-Priest and snatch away this sacred relic. Its recovery would be invaluable to further the understanding of the Great Plan, you are therefore charged to lead an expedition in this foreign land and clear the way for the Skink archeologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29;Mobilize our armiesss immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEslizardmen29001;The Lizardmen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29001;Foul news from afar: it appears a great alien fleet is sailing towards your realm, charged with coldblooded monsters. \n The mysterious lizard people of the far west have left their resting places for your realm. There is no telling why or when they will arrive, but it is clear their intentions are not peaceful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29001;We must prepare to meet them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEslizardmen29002;The Ancient Tablet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent out messengers in the name of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to inform all Skink Priests it is the will of the Mage-Priests to focus their efforts on the recovery of an ancient tablet of the Old Ones, divined into a faraway realm of savages. \n\n As a devout follower of the Old Ones, it is your duty to join the efforts of your spawn siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29002;Mobilize our armiesss immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen29002;It might resssult in a missscalculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen31005;Since the start of the war, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has appeared restless in his sleep. Many Skinks agree this is a clear sign the Slann disapproves of this war and wishes it to be ended immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen31005;Asss the Old Oness command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen31005;It could be sssomething elssse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen32005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has awaken! He has determined the victory in this war is essential to the ultimate achievement of the Great Plan and has decided to take the lead himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen32005;I bow before you, Great One.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen33005;You've done what you could to forward the Great Plan and the interests of the Old Ones in this world. Now the war is over and it is time for you to resume your duties and focus your attention in preventing Chaos from consuming all Earth. You're confident the Skinks will fill in your absence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen33005;Hnnnfffhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen34001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not wake at the first attempt. Trying again so soon would be sacrilegious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen34001;I missscalculated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen35;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] drinks much more ripplejuice than a Skink should. It clouds his vision and makes him more likely to miscalculate and less productive in his tasks. The Skinks must be informed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen35;I will at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen35001;[From.GetFirstName] has discovered [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] drinks much more ripplejuice than a Skink should. It clouds his vision and makes him more likely to miscalculate and less productive in his tasks. This is a very serious issue to be taken into account.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen35001;And ssso it ssshall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen36;Outrageous! [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] drinks the distillation of some poisonous plant. It only results in him spewing gibberish on the ground for some hours, yet, regardless of this activity being of obvious detriment to his productivity he keeps doing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen20101;SsssshhhaaaaAAAAHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen43;You Sentinels have found out a group of miyan hunters roaming about near one of your sacred sites. It was only through the grace of the Ancients these ravenous creatures didn't eat one of the sacred artifacts before being apprehended.\n The foul-smelling mammals squeak in some barbarous language, trying to plead for their useless lives, most likely.\n The Sauri are ready to make short work of the plump robbers and await your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen43;Sssave their nossess though! They bring good luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen43;They're sso fat. We'll have roassted meat for a month!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen43;Kill them and take whatever little posssessions they have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44;A wild Amazon has been captured inside your demesne. The feral mammal has lashed out against one of the Skink gatherers, almost killing him, before being tracked down and captured by the Sauri. \n The only reason she would have been killed on the spot, hadn't she known some words of your tongue to confuse the Sauri.\n The uneducated beast still makes resistance when forcefully bent before you and has the gall to demand freedom in her mangled version of the Slann's language, all the while wearing the hide of a fellow and, most importantly, productive Lizardmen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44;I sssmell Creator'ss relics insside her! Tear her OPEN!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen44;How amussing! Put it in our recreational zoo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen44;Kill her and repurpose her belongingsss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44101;You're a shame for your family, unworthy of the title of Amazon. Your [GetFromRelation] has decreed you're enceforth banished from Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44101;What!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44001;You finally met your end against a worthy opponent. If nothing less, it's a good death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44001;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44002;You've received news your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] died in a fierce fight against a creature of the dark. If nothing else, at least in death she has redeemed herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44002;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44003;You finally met your end. It wasn't even a good one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44003;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44004;You've received news your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] died in an accident of some sort. It seems that even in death she was a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44004;I will soon forget about her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44005;You really can't remember what was all the deal about female supremacy. Here people are much nicer to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44005;Yep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44006;You would have thought [From.GetFirstName] could at least die with honor, but the news you've heard tell much worst. She somehow settled with men of a foreign land, becoming a tamed and fat cow, content to be led about by some male.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44006;Disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44007;You redeemed yourself in your exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44007;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44008;Your edict may have brought some good after all: [From.GetFirstName] has returned to you, showered in glory, carring trophies of powerful beasts as gifts, and telling of her grand exploits in exile. She submits to your mercy, asking to receive another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44008;Rise again, as my [GetFromRelation] once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen44008;You can live here, but as a newborn Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen45;[Root.GetFirstName]\n My Amazons will no longer suffer the rule of a weak and decadent Queen.\n We demand you relinquish your crown at once or prepare to test your mettle in battle once more. \n\n And may the Old Gods see the truth in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen45;I will stand down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen45;You'll have to take my crown from my cold dead hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen46;[Root.GetFirstName]\n I will not suffer this treasonous act against me. \n\n We shall see how complacent I really am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen46;Indeed we shall! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen47;[Root.GetFirstName]\n I do not wish for conflict between us. I therefore relinquish my rule over this realm.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen47;Pathetic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen48;[From.GetTitledName] has recognized [From.GetHerHis] failings and abdicated the crown of this realm.\n\nPraise the Ancients!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen49;May the next Queen be stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen50;Palace life is not so bad. You can have all the pet consorts you desire and live a peaceful and easy life, without tainting yourself with brute violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAlizardmen50;This is the life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen51;[From.GetFirstName] has grown lazy and complacent in her easy life, grievously staining your family's reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen51;Hm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52001;In such a dangerous and violent world, you're lucky to be born a noble Amazon. Beautiful, free and rich, with servants for your every need. What else can a woman ask for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52001;Hmhmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52002;The jungle is a scary place, filled with poisonous plants, dangerous predators and vicious lizardmen, all too ready to sacrifice any trespasser to their bloodthirsty gods. Is it so strange for a person to extert caution in this world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52002;No it's not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52003;The elders might teach that males are nothing but cattle to be used to produce more Amazons, but how can you resist the lure of a strong man holding you? To be with another and join is such a unique experience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52003;They're not so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52004;There are many perks in the palace life, your favourite is to take the first choice of any game the huntresses have managed to hunt during the day. So many good exotic things to try out, the sweetest wine in the realm, strange new spices...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52004;Oh! What's this one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52005;Going out to hunt is such a chore. After all, what are huntresses made for? A well-bred Amazon like you should not trouble herself with such lowly work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52005;Right so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52006;Nothing scares you. Against every foe, any obstacle, your mind is steady and your heart jumps at the chance of a new adventure. You truly incarnate the ideals of Amazon lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52006;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52007;You're not an hypocrite like all those others, preaching on how they despise males, but then running into the arms of their consorts. You are one of the few to experience love in its purest form: with another woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52007;And the sweetest kind of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53001;You might have been excessive with the bloodwine. Last thing you remember before awakening in the mud is giggling naked on the roof of the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53001;Hnnn... My head!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53002;On prospect, you might have wanted to go easy on the roasted Naggaront. After a few gurgling noises from your stomach, you rush to puke on the side of a tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53002;Bleah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53003;Some of the herbs you tasted were not at all to your liking, for you soon find yourself asking for water, with your face red and a chorus of laughter accompanying your stumbling to the fountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53003;Aaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53004;One of the concoctions you drank tonight put you in contact with the spirits. You can feel them around you and speak their words to your sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53004;Heed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54001;[From.GetFirstName] sits brazenly on the other side of the fire, calling the attention of the sisters nearby and challenging to a drinking contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54001;You're on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen54001;I don't feel like drinking tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54002;You tried to push [From.GetFirstName] into a drink contest, but she did not felt up to it. By all accounts, victory is yours, although it is not a satisfactory one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54002;It'll do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54003;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted your challenge for a drinking contest. A few of the other sisters come around the fire to look as you clash the first jug with hers and take the first long sip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54003;Now you drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54004;With an absentminded look and a sallow face, [From.GetFirstName] shakes her head, admitting defeat. You laugh in triumph as the sisters rise you up and give pats on your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54004;Sshtop spinning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54005;[From.GetFirstName] holds her jug near her face, falters, and shakes her head. You laugh in triumph as the sisters rise you up and give pats on your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54005;Sshtop spinning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. Your head feels still pretty clear, you should have this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. Thinks are starting to get foggy and, as you reach for your jug, you find yourself snickering for no reason, but you should still be able to take another, shouldn't you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. At least, that must be the case, you can't really see very well. You wait the right time between hiccups and prepare to drink again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] is just a blurry image before you, across the campfire, but she's still up, which means it must be your turn. You try a few times to get a hold on the drink, until one of the sisters jams it into your hand, and prepare to have at it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54006;Jug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen54006;E-Ennough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54007;You try to hold the jug and take another sip, but your body cannot take any further and you collapss on the ground with an empty expression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54007;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55001;It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but it is now becoming clear  you and [From.GetFirstName] are quickly escalating into an open competition for the better courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55001;I'll show you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen55001;Here, take it. I think I've had enough for tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55002;It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but the moment you started to be more competitive about it [From.GetFirstName] was quick to cower away, leaving you full domain over the main courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55002;Ah! That'll teach her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55003;You drag [From.GetFirstName]'s dish towards your side of the campfire, taking mouthfuls out the course as she looks in anger. It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but it has become clear you and [From.GetFirstName] are quickly escalating into an open competition for the better courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55003;Hmmplfh!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55004;[From.GetFirstName] puts a hand before her mouth, trying to shake her hand and dragging herself away from the food in disgust, thus declaring you victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55004;Yeah! Crawl away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55005;[From.GetFirstName] rolls on the side, holding her swollen belly and letting out a painful groan with her mouth still full of half-chewed food. It appears you've prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55005;What's wrong? Having some trouble standing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen55006;[From.GetFirstName] steals one of your dishes, and starts to eat ravenously. In response, you take one of hers, chewing as fast as you can and looking for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen55006;[From.GetFirstName] still keeps eating. You look around for the next course to snatch from the cheering sisters nearby and almost puke, but it's still not too bad. You probably can take a few more courses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen55006;You look down, tapping at your swollen belly as you try to get in another bite. [From.GetFirstName] is still eating, so, unless you want to admit defeat, you must keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen55006;You gurgle, trying to hold in the last bite and take a look at your opponent, confirming she's still chewing another piece of roasted meat, before going back at your course. Probably you can take it for a little longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55006;I... can go... on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen55006;Hmmmpfh... enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55007;You roll on the sand, holding your swollen belly, incapable of eating one single bite more. You pray the gods to throw up soon while rolling exhausted on your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55007;*Blrgh*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56001;In the frenzy of the ritual celebrations, you've bumped laughing into [From.GetFirstName]. Although you didn't mean anything by it, she seemed to take it as a direct challenge and answered pushing you violently on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56001;NOW it's on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen56001;Alright, just... calm down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56002;[From.GetFirstName] just ran into you. You pushed her back, hoping for a fight, but she's too cowardly or drunk to respond and you soon lose interest in her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56002;Bah, look where you go next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56102;[From.GetFirstName] just ran into you. You pushed her back, hoping for a fight, and she seems very eager to enable you. Throwing herself right back at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56102;Come here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56004;The two of you fight off nearby the campfire, trying to get a hold on each other, hitting and breaking off.\n Soon, other sisters gather around, cheering for one or the other, as your fight grows more violent, bolstered by the screams of the other Amazons, inhebriated by the festivities in honor of the Snake-Goddess. \n You throw yourselves at each other, roll in the mud, grapple and punch at every opening.\n Finally, you manage to take a hold of your opponent from the back and squeeze, keeping her tight until she screams defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56004;YAAHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen56005;Hhhnnng! Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53005;The climax of the celebration has passed from a few hours and now you find yourself tired and happy, wrapped around your sisters, near the campfire. As you say sweet things to each other in your drunken stupor, you feel quite happy to be in such a company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53005;I love you guys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53006;Under the beating of the drums you fret and dance, alongside your sisters, screaming on the top of your lungs praises for Serena and the other Old Gods, hoping your celebration will bring their favour upon your tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53006;Hear us, almighty Creators!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53007;As the celebration reaches its climax, inhebriated by the mystic fumes of the shamans and driven into a near-frenzy by your dancing, you run around the campfire, screaming louder to make the gods notice you. \n The Elders finally carry forth the sacred snakes for the rituals to Serena, and the scaley creatures are set free amongst you.\n At first, you jump near them, teasing their bite and retreating just before they strike, then you come slower, with little offerings to endear them to you and lay down, letting them embrace and protect you as Rigg protects Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53007;Dance with us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTHslizardmen17;Sacrifice some, but keep the best for my harem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen60;Your huntresses have captured an interesting speciment from your last raid. What should be done with him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen60;I'll keep him for my collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen60;He will be sacrificed soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61;You've sent your couriers to spread the word as quick as possible: you will organize a great tournament within the great ruins so that you and your sisters may revel in the excitement of violence and the gods may take your sweat and blood as tribute and look down upon you with favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61;Rigg be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61001;Fellow Sister!\n I call upon you to shed blood in name of Rigg! Let the Great Huntress be pleased as all of the daughters of Serana fight for her favour in the great ruins!\n\n We await you.\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61001;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen61001;I think I'll pass this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61002;Rigg be praised!\n I will join you in the great ruins, sister and prove my worth for all of the Amazons to see!\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61002;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61003;Sorry, fellow sister,\n but I send this message to inform you I will not be able to take part in your great ritual this season.\n\n May Rigg forgive me.\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61003;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen62;All the able-bodied Amazons in your realm have gathered in the great ruins for the brawling tournament you've organized in honor of Rigg. Not only nobleblood to participate, but many huntresses, eager to meet the best amongst the daughters of Serena and learn by watching them fight under the eyes of the goddesses.\n All your sisters flock over the old stone steps half-eaten by the jungle, looking down in the arena in anticipation.\n Above them, the fallen statues of the Creators look down with blind eyes. As the legend goes, only when enough blood will be shed in the sand of the arena, the great statue of Rigg will come to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen62;Not enough Amazons came at your call. The great ruins lie empty before you, with just some curious huntresses roaming around. You've waited for a few days now and it is certain no one else will come.\n It is with great regret that you announce you are forced to cancel the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62;And so let the blood start spilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen62;This was a waste of time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen62001;Let's start this already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62002;As the ruling Queen of your realm, it is only right for you to be the first to fight, to honor Rigg and lead your sisters by example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62002;I will be an exemplar winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62003;It is your turn to fight for the glory of Rigg and yourself. You walk towards the centre of the arena, accompanied by the cheering of your sisters sitting and hanging from the ruins around you. [From.GetFirstName], your adversary, comes from the opposite side to meet you in the middle. You bump into each other's chest and prepare yourself for the starting drum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen62005;[From.GetFirstName] was sad to announce that, due to lack of participants, the tournament will be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62005;All this road for nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen63001;You start circling each other, waiting for the right time to strike. [From.GetFirstName] is the first to lunge forward with her spear, but you manage to dodge her and roll on the side, kicking at her ankle and making her lose balance.\n [From.GetFirstName] jumps back, avoiding your next strike, you cross spears, drawing closer to each other and, at the last moment, you headbutt her, pushing her on her back and planting your blade near her throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen63001;[From.GetFirstName] is the first to attack, waving her the point of her spear to force you in defence, you dodge and deflect her attacks as fast as you can, ignoring the small cuts and trying to wait for her to lose her thrust.\n Finally, you see an opening and strike, startling [From.GetFirstName] and managing to get close enough to strike her down and force her surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen63001;You try several feigns, but when [From.GetFirstName] finally seems to be falling for it, it turns out to be a feign on her part. You violently cross your spears and, rather than allow the other to take the other's, end up throwing both away.\n Now bare-handed, you keep on fighting in the sand, punching and kicking. Finally, you manage to grab a hold on [From.GetFirstName]'s hair and slam her head on your knee, making her pass out and achieving victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen63003;The crowd cheers as you stand over your defeated opponent, raising your ceremonial spear and proclaiming your victory to the goddesses.

EVTOPTAslizardmen63003;Who's next?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen64;You throw your spear, stained in the blood of many of your sisters, at the feet of Rigg's statue and turn to the Queen to bow down and accept the laurels of the champion.

EVTDESCAslizardmen65001;This tournament has really tested your mettle. You feel more secure, with a keener mind, eager to test yourself once more, to battle against someone. Or something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65001;I'll go hunting, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65002;This tournament has been a great test of your skills. Between the training and the strain of the challenges themselves, you feel stronger than you've ever been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65002;I could lift a tree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65003;Fretting wildly under Rigg's eyes, exchanging violent blows with your sisters, fighting to the end, this whole tournament felt you with a rage and a thirst for battle you've never felt before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65003;Rigg's touch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65004;You were just about to leave the stadium with your sisters after the final feast for your victory, when you received a mystical vision: the Huntress, stalking her scaled preys in the shadow skies over the ruined temple. You can feel her touch, Rigg has truly blessed you today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65004;And I am worthy of this blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen63001;You're the first to draw blood, slashing a light wound on [From.GetFirstName]'s arm. She waves her spear at you, forcing you to back down and stall for an opening.\n You have your chance to attack, but you trip in the sand. [From.GetFirstName] sees her opportunity and strikes down while you're on the ground.\n You manage to turn belly-up and parry her blow with your spear. She falls on you, aiming your face with her elbow, but you dodge, using her thrust to end over her, with your blade at her chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslizardmen63001;The duel starts violently, but an hour later the two of your are still fighting, without any sign of tiredness.\n [From.GetFirstName] screams and taunts you, lunging with her spear, aiming for your neck. You bend your knees and violently draw a line in the air above you with your weapon, managing to cut the tip of her spear. Before she can try and react, you've pointed your blade at her chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslizardmen63001;You attack first, but your strike ends in the sand as [From.GetFirstName] slips on the side and waves her spear lower, aiming for your legs. You jump, throwing your weapon at her, and when she dodges, you fall on her, grabbing her spear. As she tries to shake you off, [From.GetFirstName] starts biting you on the shoulder. Ignoring the pain, you keep your hold, pushing her down with your weight and finally managing to point her blade on her own neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLslizardmen63001;A few minutes in, after the duel has started, and you don't even remember where your spears might have ended. [From.GetFirstName] and stand one against the other, holding arms, trying to force your opponent down.\n Won by frustration, you try to ram into her with your last remaining strengths, managing to break the stale, but she ends being the one on top, closing her arm around your neck and starting to squeeze. In a last-ditch effort, you jab her from behind, quickly turning and landing the final punch straight on her face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen52008;An Amazon should be strong and inspire her sisters with her figure, what huntress could follow a weak leader? Your body is so frail, what does it matter if the will behind it is strong? It won't protect you if a Naggaront mauls you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52008;The body is not all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52009;When your sisters call you a strong leader, they're not speaking metaphorically: you are an example of how an Amazon Queen should be, with muscles of steel, chiseled on your arms and chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52009;Just look at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52010;You've been educated to always appease and accomodate, to always try and talk before fighting. What Amazon could respect such a spineless leader? An Amazon should not care about words, she should meet any opposition with the tip of her spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52010;Wait, come on, let's talk about this!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52011;You're a woman of few words, you prefer to let your actions speak for you. And it is well often for your actions to be violent in nature. This is the sort of Queen the Huntresses can respect, the one who fights with them and wastes no time in small talk and appeasement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52011;Rightly so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52012;When was the last time you went out to hunt alongside your sisters? Instead, you waste your days gorging on their game, growing fat and complacent on your throne. What sort of proud Warrior-Queen are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52012;The body is not all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52013;You lead Amazons, yet you yourself are by many considered just a freak. You were born wrong, they said, and rightly so. With such a deformed body, how can you be expected to defend your realm and fight with your sisters?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52013;It's not MY fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61900;It's been a long journey, but you're finally back home. A great festival to honor Rigg can only be organized every so often, it'll be at least five solar rotations before another one may be issued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61900;I had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen70;It is only a question of reading correctly the right table to understand the location of the old Temple of Rejuvenation. It is an important part of the Legacy of the Ancients and must be recovered and preserved. It is undoubtedly part of the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen70;Since childhood, you heard stories of the fabled philter of eternal life, gifted by the goddesses to their best huntresses. Now you have your chance to finde the ancient pool and bathe into it, as the legend goes, re-emerging strong and young forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen70;This will be a long and perilous voyage, but the prize will be well worth all the trouble.\n You will venture in the unknown jungles of Lustria, one of the most inhospitable places in the world, and return with the fabled philter of eternal youth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen70;Time to go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71;You were swimming deep through one of the narrow rivers choked by tne intricate flora of the jungle when you catch a series of small shadows moving the waters not too far from where you are. The savages' ambush might have been ruined, but you must fight through them to get to your destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71;You were sailing across one of the narrow rivers choked by the intricate flora of the jungle when one of your sisters is struck down by a poisonous dart. You immediately recognize it as a miyan ambush and shout to the other Amazons to shield themselves immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71;You were sailing across one of the narrow rivers choked by the intricate flora of the Lustrian jungle, when one of your guards falls from the side of your boat, with his back covered with needles. A shrieking pack of bloated miyans emerges from the trees on both sides, starting to shoot more of the poisonous darts on your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71;Wait! We don't want trouble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71;Attack!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71001;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors emerge and maul meticulously the unwary mammals before they can react. The water has turned red and thick with blood once the Sauri swim back to you giving the all-clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71001;Your arrows and spears soon find their place in the numb skulls of the miyans, killing and scaring the little men away without significant losses for your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71001;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, quickly forcing them to retreat behind the trees. You continue to shoot until you've passed the ambush point for a while, making sure the little pests are not following you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71001;We keep moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71001;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71002;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors emerge and maul meticulously the unwary mammals from below. Even then, the litte creatures manage to toss some spears and shoot some darts back, killing a Saurus and even managing to reach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71002;Your arrows and spears soon find their place in the numb skulls of the miyans, killing and scaring the little men away. Even so, you lose another sister and are wounded yourself before finally winning the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71002;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, but suffer several losses before finally managing to force them to retreat. You continue to shoot until you've passed the ambush point and only then realize you've been wounded by the little creeps as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71002;Grmphf!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71002;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71003;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors swim towards the mammals, but the creatures manage to see the coming attackers and react with uncanny speed. The Sauri are struck through the head by their spears and a storm of poisonous darts falls upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71003;One after the other, your Amazons fall to the poisonous darts of the miyans. Some do not even manage to take any of them before falling, an ignominous death. You are among the last, keeping on fighting until the poison takes away your last strengths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71003;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, but suffer several losses and are finally overcome by the miyans. You're riddled with poisonous darts as you try to leave the boat and fall head-first into the water, slowly sinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71003;Ghhhh!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71004;Speaking in their dialect and explaining your quest, you manage to calm down the miyans. They've dealt with Amazons before and, although it was not always a peaceful experience, they agree to let you and your sisters pass through their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71004;Hard to believe half-males would be so reasonable…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71005;You've tried to explain you and your sisters mean no harm to the miyans and only desire to travel on, but their chief appears to have had already unpleasant experiences with other Amazons and screams to resume the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71005;Fine! You brought this on yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen72;It looks like another coming storm at first, but as the thundering noise grows stronger, you realize it's much worse: the trees in front of you shake violently and are eradicated as a pack of crazed stegadonts rampages through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBslizardmen72002;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen72003;The thunder-lizards have not even noticed your group, but moving away from their trajectory fast enough is still no easy trick. Despite your best efforts, you end up with your brains splattered on the pawns of the mighty creatures, thus ending your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen72003;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a yellow-snatcher, when you finally catch the feeble scent of other Lizardmen. You emit a high-pitched hiss, and the ambushers come out, weapons still at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a yellow-snatcher, when you finally realize one of your sisters has gone missing. You call the others to alert and catch the shimmering of scales from above you. It's the Lizardmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a strange flower, when you finally realize one of your men has gone missing. You call the others to alert and catch the shimmering of scales from above you. It's the Lizardmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73;There'sss no need for violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen73;Attack!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73001;You've stained yourself with the blood of fellow Lizardmen. It is impossible to say how their loss may impact or slow down the achievement of the Great Plan. This is not a good day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73001;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your sisters have better aiming skills. You keep firing arrows as you run across the canyon, finally reaching a shielded point and carefully proceeding from there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73001;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your men have superior firepower.. You keep shooting the higher slope as you march across the canyon, finally reaching a shielded point and carefully proceeding from there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73001;We must keep moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen73001;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73002;You've stained yourself with the blood of fellow Lizardmen. It is impossible to say how their loss may impact or slow down the achievement of the Great Plan. This is not a good day. Even worse, in their misguided efforts, the enemy Lizardmen managed to wound you and kill some of the Sauri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73002;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your sisters have better aiming skills. You keep firing arrows as you run across the canyon, but there's no safe point in sight and you end losing several good sisters before leaving the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73002;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your men have superior firepower... You keep shooting the higher slope as you march across the canyon,  but there's no safe point in sight and you end losing several good men before leaving the canyon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBslizardmen73002;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73003;You've stained yourself with the blood of fellow Lizardmen and still have not managed to fulfill your self-imposed task. Your misguided attackers take full advantage of their superior position and numbers to whither down your forces, until there's no one of you left standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73003;You thought your aiming skills would have been enough to counteract the Lizardmen's highter ground, but it was to no avail. The poisonous field slows you and before you know it, a spear falls into your back, pinning you on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73003;You hoped to scare the creatures away with your superior firepower, but the Lizardmen are resilient and the poisonous flowers slow your men's reflexes. They fall one after the other and in the end your turn comes as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73003;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73004;A Saurus was leading the pack of Lizardmen on the slope of the canyon, while he was quick to action, he was also very receptive when he recognized you as a Skink Chief and carefully listened to your words before hissing to his warriors to stand down and let you pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73004;There wasss no doubt about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73005;A Saurus was leading the pack of Lizardmen on the slope of the canyon, they are made to be quick to anger and violence and it turns out to be impossible to catch his attention to speak with him now that he's in a frenzy. You will have to fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73005;Hmmssssshhh…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen75;You've spent years scouring the deadly jungles of Lustria, but still no trace of the fabled Fountain of Youth. Your funds for this expedition have been depleted. Perhaps it is time to renounce to this foolish quest and return to your home, before dying or being driven insane by your obsession?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen75;No! I've enough resources to found another expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen75;I have neither money nor strength to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74;This might finally be it. The old ruins lay before you, buried under layers upon layers of jungle plants, but the glyphs leave no doubt about it: this is the place you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74;Check for traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen74;Let's move!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74001;Three of your group fall into a pit trap right as they walk on the final staircase. Luckily, you are alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74001;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74002;Three of your group fall into a spiked pit trap right as they walk on the final staircase. One of them almost drags you to the same end, but you manage to hold onto the edge and survive, albeit wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74002;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74003;The portal to the inner temple is so close, but in your rush, you are doomed: a pitfall opens under your feet and you fall screaming alongside your warriors to a spikey death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74003;AaaaaAAAAHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74004;You were right to check for traps. There are several levers and false steps to be disabled or avoided altogether. You manage to get safely across the final staircase and cross the main portal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74004;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. And yet, you can still make out some of the prophecies written upon them. This is the place where your quest will end. You know there will be a guardian and when the Coatl floats down, wrapping his coils on the columns between you and the final room and spitting words of warning, you are ready to bow down before him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. They are the tongue of the Ancients, whose understanding has been long-forgotten by the Amazons. Yet you know your close and you feel the traps could not have been your final test.\n It is then that the Coatl floats down from the ceiling, hissing and wrapping his coils along the columns of the main corridor to block your way. He might threatening you in the ancient tongue, but it's hard for you to understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. Not that you could understand them in any case.\n You're focused on the faint light coming from the end of the main corridor, you know that's your final destination, you can almost hear the sound of the water. \n None of your group realizes the danger untile the massive feathered snake floats from above, spitting poison and fire upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen76;Guardian of the Old Ones, hear my plea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen76;*Try to speak in the ancient tongue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen76;We must attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen77;"The Coatl stares deeply into your soul, hissing slowly.\n ""You have been created to accomplish this task. But such is not the task you believed to be fighting for when you left your pool. You will be thus allowed to enter the source of Rejuvenation, so that you may serve the Creators in your ultimate goal, but you shall never mention of this place, nor bring anything with you. Such is the will of the Ancients.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen77;"The Coatl stares deeply into your soul, hissing slowly.\n ""You were not created to accomplish this task, yet you are here. It is not the will of the Ancients for you to drink from this well, nor to share its knowledge with your siblings. You were wrong by coming here, yet the Ancients still have a place for you in your grand design. Return from whence you came, forget about this place and accomplish their true will.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen77;I am humbled and ready to do the will of the godsss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen77;This *mussst* be my task! Ssstand aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen77;I recoil at your wordsss, o mighty one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen77001;It took a messenger of the Old Gods themselves to let you understand the error of your ways, but you understand now this quest was never yours to take. You will return home, to your predesigned duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen77001;Yesss…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78;It is difficult to pronounce the proper words and even more difficult to understand the answer of the Coatl. There is no doubt he is angered about something and, after a few repetitions, it is clear what is the general meaning of his answer: you are not meant to be in this place, you've angered the gods and, unless you flee immediately, he shall crush and swallow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78;(Lie) Let me offer myself as compensation for the offense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen78;Not if I kill you first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen78;I will do as the Ancients command…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78001;The Coatl is initially surprised by your offering, but his tone turns pleased soon enough. You lay on the ground, tossing aside your spear and ordering to your sisters to stand back, and call for the great snake to take the offering again.\n The Coatl slithers towards you, opening his jaws, and with a slow movement of his neck starts swallowing you.\n You hold your breath and await until you're completely inside the creature, then free your dagger and violently stab the creature's head from the inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78001;Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78002;The Coatl shakes his head at the first stab, but, before you can cut deeper, drowns you in a flow of fire and poison, ending your little deception in a swift swallow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78002;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78003;The Coatl shakes his head, trying to spit you out, but you stab deeper, piercing his skull and cutting into his brain again and again. The body of the creature twists and whirls as your sisters start to attack it as well, until it finally crumbles into the ground and you emerge from it, covered in spit and blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78003;AAAHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79;The great snake whirls his coils around the entire corridors, whipping and spitting and lunging with his fangs, killing a warrior with each strike.\n You strike it again and again, cutting through his scales at dozens of points, but the blades and spears can barely draw blood.\n At every burst of fire, your forces dwindle, if you do not kill the guardian soon, you will not survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79;Kill him! Kill him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79001;The guardian was too strong for your tired forces. With a final swoop, the Coatl burns the remaining warriors and crushes you under his deadly coils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79001;Arrghh…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79002;Bleeding from a thousand cuts, the great snake finally falls, defeated. You stand over his carcass, cutting away his head and proceed further. None of your warriors survived, but that doesn't matter anymore…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79002;I'm so close…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen80;There it is, not like you expected, actually. It's not a fountain at all, more like a pool, shimmering with unearthly light, water boiling but exhaling no warmth you can perceive. You slowly and carefully enter, one foot at a time, bending over the surface to take a deep sip.\n The liquid has no flavor, but as it runs through your body, you feel immediately reinvigorated, you feel yourself young and strong as never before.\n The legends were true and you've been one of the very few to find the source of eternal life and partake in it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen80;I shall be young forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen57001;You are dancing alongside your sisters under the pale moons. Your head is a little light from all you've drank and in a pirouette you inadvertitely fall giggling on [From.GetFirstName] she laughs as well, falling with you and likely just as drunk.\n The sand is cold, but you feel her body warm on yours and quickly search for her lips.\n When you're tired and your head starts clearing a bit, you find yourself hugging each other near the camp fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57001;Oh, I love you, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen57003;[From.GetFirstName] shares your feelings for her. It appears this year Serena bore more than just lust with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57003;I love you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen57004;You spend some more time cuddling [From.GetFirstName] before you laugh it off and get back to the other. It was certainly a crazy night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57004;We should do this again sometimes…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCQslizardmen63001;You strike [From.GetFirstName] at the ankle with the side of your spear, forcing her on her knees, but she quickly thrusts her weapon at you in retaliation. You step back, avoiding her spear, and she takes advantage of it to throw herself at your legs.\n You roll together in the sand, wrestling for control over your spear, until you finally manage to stop on top of her, squeezing her neck between your legs and pointing the spear at her face with a triumphant yell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCRslizardmen63001;[From.GetFirstName] exchanges a few blows with you before pointing her spear on the ground to use it as lever and kick you in the face. \n Temporarely dazed by her attack, you try to step back, but she keeps close, drawing first blood from your arm in an attempt to loosen your grip on your weapon. You hold the spear and attempt a counterattack with one hand, but you can't put enough strength in the weapon to parry hers. In the end, driven by frustration, you just throw the spear, managing to get it through her leg and achieving victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSslizardmen63001;The fight doesn't start in the best way: [From.GetFirstName] manages to push you down with her shoulder, sliding her spear on the back of your neck, pressing your face against the sand.\n You feel your mind sleeping away as you wiggle, trying to breathe, but finally manage to break her hold with a violent kick on her knee. You crouch and snatch away her spear, battering your head on her chest and holding her down until she surrenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTslizardmen63001;The fight starts well, you push [From.GetFirstName] down, take her hair from behind and start banging her head on the sand.\n [From.GetFirstName] struggles, but you keep your hold until she seems to be finally losing her strength. It is at that point that she rolls on the side, grabbing your spear and pushing it back to your jaw.\n You shake away the pain and wave the spear to free it from her hold, finally managing to pin her back down and squeeze her until she passes out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With both weapons pointed at you, you are forced to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen82001;It is a very good day for a hunt and all the needs of command tend to take your [GetFromRelation] away from the true meaning of Amazonian lifestyle. Maybe you should ask her to go on a hunt with you, make sure her senses are still keen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen82001;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen82001;Maybe another time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen82002;[From.GetFirstName] has come to you asking if you'd like to go out with her for a hunt. The day is bright and a exotic creatures await for your blades and arrows. What do you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen82002;Yes, please! I can't stand it here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen82002;I'm kind of busy right now…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen83;It gets discomforting, at times, how the burden of command prevents you from enjoying life like any other huntress, running in the wilds, stalking monsters. When those thoughts start festering your mind, you can only find solace in a good barrel of ripplejuice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen83;The burden of command might not allow you to enjoy life like any huntress, running in the wilds, but that doesn't mean you have to wither away on your throne. You have still many friends at court and many fun ways to spend your nights without going through the trouble of hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen83;…And anoth-*hic*er for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen84;The pleasure of hunting down your own food is better than any delicacy. Yet, forced to spend all this time in your palace, you have had to give it up to the other huntresses. Is it so hard to think you'd experience that taste once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen84;You let out an annoyed sigh, pinching a roll of fat at your hip. Amazons are meant to run free, hunt and fight, it's not your fault you've been burdened by the duty of command. Your body is just not accustomed to staying still for so long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen84;It's not really my fault…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen85;You stumble on the carpet, letting out a whimper when you scratch your elbow on the ground. You used to be stronger, you used to be tougher, but being forced to spend so much time at palace, making and upholding rules and resolving disputes… It tires you without strengthening you, while your body slowly withers away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen85;You take a look at your arm, skinny and pale. It's hard to imagine how it was when you still had muscles in it. But how can an Amazon flourish, captive in her own palace? You feel so ashamed at yourself, how can you be the strong ruler your sisters look up to when you can barely lift a spear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen85;I feel so frail…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen86;You don't need to search excitement outside in the jungle! You can have all you want, you're a Queen of Amazonia! Fruit, meat, males, girls, all you can think of can be given with a snap of your fingers. Why should you care about the bad rumors about you? They come from envious people, and should be disregarded as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen86;You don't need to search excitement outside in the jungle! You can have all you want, you're a Queen of Amazonia! Fruit, meat, males, girls, all you can think of can be given with a snap of your fingers. And you can share it too, so that all the huntresses can enjoy pleasures beyond their wildest dreams, just like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen86;Let's party!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen87;You had a lot of fun with [FromFrom.GetFirstName], even though she was clearly out of your league. When you returned back at palace, all covered in mud, sweat and blood, all loaded with meat and trophies, you were exhausted, but you felt alive more than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen87;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen87001;You had a lot of fun hunting with [From.GetFirstName], although you barely managed to land a few blows on the critters of the jungle. She really is worthy of respect, a ruler like her, still so skilled with the bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen87001;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen89;This hunt is turning into a disaster. You barely made it out alive until now, you got separated from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and are lost at night in the jungle. You don't know yet if you'll manage to reach home in time, if you do, you might want to think through before accepting to go on another wild hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen89;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen89001;This hunt is turning into a disaster. You barely made it out alive until now, you got separated from [From.GetFirstName] and are lost at night in the jungle. You don't know yet if you'll manage to reach home in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen89001;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88;The hunt is proceding fairly well. Both you and [From.GetFirstName] are having fun and have captured a couple of small preys. As you go on though, it becomes clear you're evenly matched and that is enough to spark the spirit of competition within the both of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88;We'll see who catches the bigger game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88001;The Culchan shrieks when you jump from the tree and land on his back. [From.GetFirstName] is ready to point her spear at him, rising from her cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples her, running away and trying to shake you off.\n You hold onto your spear, sunking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. You're finally thrown off the prey, but you roll easily back on your feet, catching [From.GetFirstName]'s spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen88001;A Naggaront you could handle, but, when you entered the cave, you didn't expect to find a nest. At that point it was too late to call off the attack, the two creatures had already caught your stench.\n You throw an arrow at the first, managing to land a lucky shot in its eyes and running for the exit, where [From.GetFirstName] waits for you.\n You put down your spears right before the monsters come out, managing to have them impale themselves with their own charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen88001;You and [From.GetFirstName] run around in circles, yelling at the top of your lungs, but never leaving the safety of the trees as the pack of crazed Stegandons growls and trumpets, trying to find a way out of the fire you started.\n When the stampede finally gets underway, you start trowing arrows at them, until you've singled out the weaker reptile. Slowed the creature down, you jump on its back together, thrusting your spears many times over in the fissue at the back of its neck, under its bone collar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen88001;You keep holding your breath, eyes pointed up as the Terradon slowly approaches the surface of the river to drink. At the last possible moment, you swim out, charging your spear through the creature's chest. The Terradon shrieks, flapping his wings in an attempt to flee.\n You wrap your arms around his neck while [From.GetFirstName] jumps on his back and stabs him again.\n For a few seconds you are left hanging over the trees, but the Terradon cannot sustain the both of you while wounded and finally crashes down, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslizardmen88001;You jump behind a rock just in time to avoid the jet of fire spitted by the angry salamander. Quickly putting out a spark in your hair, you look for [From.GetFirstName], readying your bow. The other huntress is crouched on a tree, already aiming. The moment she fires the salamander stops and you leave cover, shooting a second arrow straight into its mouth.\n The monster jerks and coughs, before trying to get out another firey breath, but at that point you have already managed to get close enough to bury your spear under his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslizardmen88001;Hunting down the little lizard led you to an unknown abandoned ruin. You decided to explore it, but a few steps inside and you are already fending off spikey walls, fall pits and poisonous darts.\n You get separated from [From.GetFirstName] and decided to proceed on your own. You carefully avoid a series of false steps and reach the final chamber. The snake idol exposed there is just too pretty to be left alone, but when you take it, a giant boulder falls from above. It is right when you're fleeing for your life that you stumble on [From.GetFirstName] and barely manage to cross the temple's door before getting squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen88001;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding decent preys. The little men yell and shoot darts at you as you run with [From.GetFirstName], charged with meat and pelts. You slide to a river and follow its course with the little pests on your heels, then jump off when you reach a waterfall, barely managing to swim back to surface after you land in the torrent with all that extra weight. You quickly run into the wild, before the Miyans may find a safer way down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslizardmen88001;You hold your breath, pressing behind the tree, looking into every corner, trying to spot the creature. [From.GetFirstName] lays a few feets away, unconscious from a poisoned dart. You barely managed to avoid a similar fate, but now you have to bring her back home immediately. The hunter hisses from the shadows, invisible. You fire a warning shot in what you think it's his general direction, but no avail. Finally, you catch a movement in the leaves and shoot again, this time wounding him. The creature shrieks and you, taking advantage of the distraction, take [From.GetFirstName] and try and run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslizardmen88001;The Kroxigor roars, ignoring the wounds on his side and under his eyes. He lowers his head and charges [From.GetFirstName]. The huntress manages to avoid the worst of it, but she's still knocked off. You throw your spear at the creature's back while it's charging your mate, but the Kroxigor just takes the spear out with a grunt and throws it away.\n You plant another arrow near his eye, enraging him further and wait to the last second before jumping away from its charge. The Kroxigor ends sticking his horns on the side of a tree. Before he manages to tear it off, you're back with your spear, plunging it again and again in his back until he finally collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLslizardmen88001;You yell and charge against the Spinodon, falling on your knees at the last second and plunging your spear under his chest, where his scales are thinner. [From.GetFirstName] joins you, attacking him from the side and trying to roll it over, but the creature manages to whip its tails at her, pushing her away. You keep a firm hold on your spear, keeping the Spinodon's jaws away as more and more of his blood spills over you, soaking your skin and enticing your senses. Finally, the monster stops, hanging his head on your weapon, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMslizardmen88001;The Carnosaur's jaws snap a few inches from [From.GetFirstName]'s back, taking away a few of her hair in the process. You're a little further, running from the beast.\n You've tried your best, but this doesn't seem like a creature to take down with just two huntresses.\n The reptile roars, carelessly uprooting trees as it pursues you in its frenzy. [From.GetFirstName] almost get trampled at a certain point, but you manage to push her on the side in time. The Carnosaur only stops when you jump off a cliff, roughly landing on some trees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCNslizardmen88001;The Culchan shrieks when you jump from the tree and land on his back. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is ready to point her spear at him, rising from her cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples her, running away and trying to shake you off.\n You hold onto your spear, sunking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. You're finally thrown off the prey, but you roll easily back on your feet, catching [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCOslizardmen88001;A Naggaront you could handle, but, when you entered the cave, you didn't expect to find a nest. At that point it was too late to call off the attack, the two creatures had already caught your stench.\n You throw an arrow at the first, managing to land a lucky shot in its eyes and running for the exit, where [FromFrom.GetFirstName] waits for you.\n You put down your spears right before the monsters come out, managing to have them impale themselves with their own charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCPslizardmen88001;You and [FromFrom.GetFirstName] run around in circles, yelling at the top of your lungs, but never leaving the safety of the trees as the pack of crazed Stegandons growls and trumpets, trying to find a way out of the fire you started.\n When the stampede finally gets underway, you start trowing arrows at them, until you've singled out the weaker reptile. Slowed the creature down, you jump on its back together, thrusting your spears many times over in the fissue at the back of its neck, under its bone collar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCQslizardmen88001;You keep holding your breath, eyes pointed up as the Terradon slowly approaches the surface of the river to drink. At the last possible moment, you swim out, charging your spear through the creature's chest. The Terradon shrieks, flapping his wings in an attempt to flee.\n You wrap your arms around his neck while [FromFrom.GetFirstName] jumps on his back and stabs him again.\n For a few seconds you are left hanging over the trees, but the Terradon cannot sustain the both of you while wounded and finally crashes down, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCRslizardmen88001;You jump behind a rock just in time to avoid the jet of fire spitted by the angry salamander. Quickly putting out a spark in your hair, you look for [FromFrom.GetFirstName], readying your bow. The other huntress is crouched on a tree, already aiming. The moment she fires the salamander stops and you leave cover, shooting a second arrow straight into its mouth.\n The monster jerks and coughs, before trying to get out another firey breath, but at that point you have already managed to get close enough to bury your spear under his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSslizardmen88001;Hunting down the little lizard led you to an unknown abandoned ruin. You decided to explore it, but a few steps inside and you are already fending off spiked walls, pits traps and poisonous darts.\n You get separated from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and decide to proceed on your own. You carefully avoid a series of false steps and reach the final chamber. The snake idol placed there is just too pretty to be left alone, but when you take it, a giant carved boulder falls from above. It is right when you're fleeing for your life that you stumble on [From.GetFirstName] and barely manage to cross the temple's entrance before getting squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTslizardmen88001;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding better prey.

lizardman261desc;Keeping the dense jungle of Lustria at bay is a constant and dangerous struggle.

He and his band defended Mage-Lord Pocaxalan in his last-ditch effort to save the city with a great spell. But alas, the fickle powers of Chaos tricked Pocaxalan, and he tapped too deeply into the howling Winds of Magic —  The Slann and his last protectors were sucked into the Realm of Chaos.\n\nNo more Chameleon Skinks spawned after the disappearance of Oxyotl. Now, somehow, he has returned from the Realm of Chaos, and the Chameleons have begun to appear again. Chameleon Skinks do not dwell within the temple-cities, but instead strike out deep into the Lustrian jungles. During invasions or times of war, they appear to put themselves at the disposal of the Skink Chiefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAsnehekharan22;I command them to fall back and change their path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan22;I command them to reassure the locals of their good intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan22;This is no concern of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23;Luckily [From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to understand the problem and has had [From.GetHerHis] undead troops discretely fall back, pursuing less exposed patrols, hopefully placating the fears of the living.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan23005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent an envoy to thank you for your wisdom regarding the issue of your troops scaring [From.GetHerHis] subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan23005;I still don't see what was scary about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24;Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has ruled otherwise on your plea to retreat some of the undead from your countryside. In fact, there are now frequent reports of people scared away from the province by skeletons trying to speak with them in hissing voices and dead languages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24;What are they doing?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan24005;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is still unsatisfied with your solution to the problem of the craven subjects in [From.GetHerHis] provinces. The living keep on mistrusting and shying away, despite your servants' attempts at reassuring them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan24005;Are they hiding something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25;You thought the worst when receiving news of the undead approaching directly your subjects, but, astonishingly enough, your people managed to find common ground with the creatures and are starting to get along fine with each other, trusting the immortal soldiers to be ever-watchful over their land and possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25;Who'd have thought?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan25005;Just as you assumed, it was only a question of showing the integrity and discipline of Nehekharan troops to reassure the people under [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan25005;It's obvious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26;The response of [From.GetTitledFirstName] was the same as that of [From.GetHerHis] soldier: silence. You keep on receiving complaints about your subjects, but there's not really much you can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26;Why they have to be so creepy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan26005;Your vassal finally stopped with [From.GetHerHis] meaningless complaints about your soldiers scaring the local populace. After all, if they've done nothing wrong, what do they have to fear about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan26005;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan27;Since you can remember you've heard incredible and terrible stories about your liege lord and the palace of immortal corpses they live in. Now that there's an opportunity to travel there, you're not sure you want to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan27;I'm not scared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan27;Maybe when I'm older...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan28;Amongst the visitors from the lands of the living under your rule, you've been surprised to see a strange creature. Although covered in flesh, it is smaller than any being you remember, be it human, dwarf or halfling, with short limbs and big eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan28;I shall speak with [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan28;A creature so small has to be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan29;The tall and dessicated undead, wrapped in golden robes, is finally in front of you and starts speaking in a strange and hissing voice, despite [From.GetHerHis] mouth hanging still. The creature leans forward, as if [From.GetSheHe] was about to grab you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan29;H-Hello! How do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan29;*Fight back!*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsnehekharan29;*Flee*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30;Not only you discovered to your surprise that the creature is in fact your vassal, [From.GetSheHe] explained you that [From.GetSheHe] is a child, that's why [From.GetSheHe] is so small. That still sounds strange, you don't remember ever being like that, even when alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30;At least [From.GetSheHe] can talk properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan30005;In the end the undead just wanted to talk with you, [From.GetSheHe] didn't mean any harm and looked just surprised to know you are a kid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan30005;Just for now, though!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31;The creature was more dangerous than you realized. When you tried to approach it and see what it was, it screamed something and attacked you, shortly after running away with one of your sacred ribs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31;Come back here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan31005;The undead guards are still looking for you, but you think they'll be more busy recovering the trophy you snatched from [From.GetHerHis] ribcage to worry about you getting out of this tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan31005;I still showed [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32;At your very sight the little creature started twitching and, before you could even say something, it was running away, screaming with an high-pitched voice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32;What the...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan32005;Luckily, you managed to save yourself from the evil undead before it could suck your soul. You'll never return to this cursed tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan32005;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan33;Don't know why, maybe because of the lack of eyes, but the undead lord has ignored you for all the time you've been in [From.GetHerHis] palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan33;Maybe it's for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan34;You've suffered a great shortage of water this year, with many oasis running low or dry. You've tried to plead to your undead overlords, but they've been silent for the most part.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan34;I'll ask directly to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan34;It's no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan35;You've received word from one of your Nehekkan vassals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] for some strange reason is asking for a great deal of water for [From.GetHerHim]self and [From.GetHerHis] subjects. You do remember water had no flavour for the living either, so you're not sure why [From.GetSheHe] would need any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan35;If they want to damp themselves, let them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan35;This is nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36;Fortunately your liege has seen the desperate needs of your tribe and has sent some of [From.GetHerHis] servants to gather water for your subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36;The gods be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan36005;Unfortunately your liege has been as silent as [From.GetHerHis] servants and refused to give any help in the search for water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan36005;We'll find something eventually...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCsnehekharan37;You remember enjoying being at a table with friends, partaking in the fruits of the land, when you were alive. Yet all food tastes like ash and all wine like sand. There's no pleasure in feasting and no joy in conversation. Your servants are silent and empty, your lords envious pretenders of past and future generations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsnehekharan37;I hate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsnehekharan37;This is just too sad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan38;You still have some memories of the days when you were alive, the anger, the passion... Yet all is still and cold now. You rule jointly with another pretender, maybe your new wife could be interested in trying to relive what was like to love a man, however rotten be his corpse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBsnehekharan38;It doesn't matter. I'm past that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsnehekharan40;For some weeks now the pretender you decided to rule along with has started making some strange pressures.
