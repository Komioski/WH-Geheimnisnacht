# ASRAI GOVERNMENTS
#
eternal_court_government;Eternal Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;
eternal_court_government_desc;The Asrai live in a harmonious co-existance with the denizers of Athel Loren, but are known for their frivolous and sometimes savage behavior. Their society revolves around the cycles of the forest, as determined by the Avatars of Ishtar and Kurnous, who rule over the High Lords of the Glades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#
# ASUR GOVERNMENTS
#
highborn_government;Highborn Concordate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
highborn_government_desc;The High Elves rely on a mild form of autocracy, centered on cities rather than fortresses. While the elven Princes are respected and obeyed and pass down their titles by blood, they are required to treat properly all their highborn subjects. Elven rulers cannot imprison any of their subjects without a proper reason and cannot revoke titles from their elven vassals, except in some extreme circumstances. In return, they have absolutely no obligations in regards of their inferior non-elven subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
everqueen_government;Court of the Everqueen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
everqueen_government_desc;The court of the Everqueen moves through Avelorn from place to place like a great carnival, pitching silken pavilions of myriad colours wherever it halts. By day, silver laughter rings through the forest as the Elves make sport. By night, faery lights flicker in the darkness, drifting behind the Everqueen's courtiers and illuminating the revels and feasting. With its perfect weather, bountiful forests and beautiful near-immortal inhabitants Avelorn seems the sort of rustic paradise of which mortal men can only dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#
# BEASTMAN GOVERNMENTS
#
beastman_government;Warherd;;;;;;;;;;;;;
beastman_government_desc;The Beastmen are anarchic and warmongering. Their herds never settle down in one place and as they migrate they destroy everything on their path. Each warherd is led by the strongest bull, who is often challenged for dominance by its subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# CHAOS GOVERNMENTS
#
chaos_horde_government;Chaos Horde;;;;;;;;;;;;;

#
norscan_government;Norscan Tribes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
norscan_government_desc;Norsca is inhabited by a race of savage and ferocious Men; fur-clad warriors and berserkers of hairy brawn who sail the seas in fearsome longships in order to unleash their devastating fury upon the south. Warlike and cruel, the Norse are the very epitome of the Warriors of Chaos; fanatically devoted champions of the Dark Gods and the baneful scourge of their foes. Norsca is a savage and brutal land, plagued by lethal winters for more than half the year, and worse, lashed perpetually by raging gales of Chaos energies howling down from the ancient ruins of the fallen Warp Gate resting at the very heart of the northern Chaos Wastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

chaos_host_government;Chaos Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaos_host_government_desc;Out of all the many threats that the Old World must face, none strikes such fear and misery into the hearts of Men like the Followers of Chaos. Slaves to darkness all, they have given themselves wholly to the Ruinous Powers, some willingly, others because they felt they had no other choice. Chaos itself is a corrupting influence upon the world, like a dark, malign cancer that eats at the minds of all those that live within the World. No single race, no matter how noble or powerful, will ever be safe from their barbaric invasions, nor are they safe from the seductive whispers of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# DRUCHII GOVERNMENTS
#
druchii_government;Nagarythian Ascendancy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
druchii_government_desc;The Druchii are proud and stubborn as their insular cousins, but they are also vicious raiders and slavers renown for their cruelty.

#
malekith_government;Witch Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
malekith_government_desc;The Witch King has created his realm upon fear and ruthlessness, asserting near-absolute power over all of his subjects.

#
# DAWI GOVERNMENTS
#
dwarf_government;Dwarfish Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dwarf_government_desc;"The Dwarfs base their feudal-like government upon millennia-old traditions. Usually, Dwarf rulers ""lease"" lands to their subjects, as well as the clan halls, forges, and mines in them. In turn, the subjects must provide back a proportion of all gold and precious minerals extracted from the leased lands, and a levy is placed upon their holds. The Dwarfs are highly isolationist and bear little love for surface-dwellers, but they maintain great respect towards their own.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
#
# DAWI ZHARR GOVERNMENTS
#
chaosdwarf_government;Sorcerous Conclave;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chaosdwarf_government_desc;The Chaos Dwarfs are ruled by the tyrannical Sorcerer-Prophets of Hashut, who assert their rule through fear and magical might granted to them by the Bullfather. Not all Chaos Dwarf rulers are Sorcerer-Prophets though, and indeed, most are petty warlords and slavemasters known as Despots or Overlords. Despite not being Sorcerer-Prophets, Chaos Dwarf custom still dictates that they must govern from the Ziggurat-Temples of Hashut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# GOBLIN/ORC GOVERNMENTS
#
greenskin_government;Warband;;;;;;;;;;;;x
greenskin_government_desc;Greenskin groups like to call themselves in many flashy ways: Tribes, Klans, Mobz, Warbands... in the end, they all amount to the same, a group of warlike individuals kept together by the biggest and strongest Greenskin specimen around, who will often get his position challenged, and himself killed if not strong enough to defend it. Greenskins don't have a concept of law beyond strength, and thus ignore the De Jure laws of any realm. They can also freely revoke the titles of any non-Greenskin vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#
freeboota_government;Orc Freebootaz;;;;;;;;;;;;x
freeboota_government_desc;"Freebootaz" are Greenskins that have either built a ramshackle ship of some kind or have managed to get their hands on a sailing vessel and have taken to the sea, where they raid and loot and pillage as their kind is want to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
lizardmen_government;Legacy of the Ancients;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lizardmen_government_desc;Since the fall of the polar gate and the departure of the Old Ones, the Slann have been in deep telepathic council, trying to discern how to better cleanse the world from Chaos and bring about the Great Plan of their creators. As the ancient Mage-Priests remain in trance, the lesser breeds of Sauri and Skinks have been left to their own devices, trying to protect the ancient relics and understand the uttered profecies of the sleeping Slann.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

pirate_government;Pirate Fleet;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pirate_government_desc;Pirate fleets are alliances of multiple pirate crews banded together under a common flag and a single leader they have chosen to follow for strength of numbers, loyalty, or just a demonstrated ability of their elected leader to gather booty. The collection of crews within the fleet are of diverse nature, being seabound bandits, professional privateers working for the benefit of another, merchants deciding to pay in steel and shot instead of gold and silver, or even the military of a realm itself engaged in plundering their political rivals. The individual crews within the fleet are highly autonomous and come to the aid of their leader when called upon to put together a mightly piratical armada under the black flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In a Skaven society status is everything and every Skaven is ready to grovel, lie and betray his way to the top. Skaven tend to live underground in sprawling cities, but it is their dream to ascend and eat and enslave all of the things who live on the surface. The Underempire is a fractious realm, nominally ruled by the Council of Thirteen, presided by the twelve most powerful Warlords and the Horned Rat himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
