#
tzardom_government;Tzardom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tzardom_government_desc;The lands of the north are ruled by a centralized autocratic monarchy governed by hereditary rulers known as the Tzar or Tzarina.

#
# ARABYAN GOVERNMENTS
#
muslim_government_desc;The Arabyan Iqta system is similar to the Feudal system - rulers must rely on land holding vassals of varying loyalty and ambition.

strigoi_government;Flesh-Eater Court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
strigoi_government_desc;After many bloody betrayals, the few remaining Strigoi Vampires were forced to scatter themselves all across the Old World in the hopes of evading persecution.

#
# ASUR GOVERNMENTS
#
highborn_government;Highborn Concordate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
highborn_government_desc;The High Elves rely on a mild form of autocracy, centered on cities rather than fortresses. While the elven Princes are respected and obeyed and pass down their titles by blood, they are required to treat properly all their highborn subjects. Elven rulers cannot imprison any of their subjects without a proper reason and cannot revoke titles from their elven vassals, except in some extreme circumstances. In return, they have absolutely no obligations in regards of their inferior non-elven subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
everqueen_government;Court of the Everqueen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
everqueen_government_desc;The court of the Everqueen moves through Avelorn from place to place like a great carnival, pitching silken pavilions of myriad colours wherever it halts. By day, silver laughter rings through the forest as the Elves make sport. By night, faery lights flicker in the darkness, drifting behind the Everqueen's courtiers and illuminating the revels and feasting. With its perfect weather, bountiful forests and beautiful near-immortal inhabitants Avelorn seems the sort of rustic paradise of which mortal men can only dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

chaos_host_government;Chaos Host;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_host_government_desc;Out of all the many threats that the Old World must face, none strikes such fear and misery into the hearts of Men like the Followers of Chaos. Slaves to darkness all, they have given themselves wholly to the Ruinous Powers, some willingly, others because they felt they had no other choice. Chaos itself is a corrupting influence upon the world, like a dark, malign cancer that eats at the minds of all those that live within the World. No single race, no matter how noble or powerful, will ever be safe from their barbaric invasions, nor are they safe from the seductive whispers of the Dark Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Warlike and cruel, the Norse are the very epitome of the Warriors of Chaos; fanatically devoted champions of the Dark Gods and the baneful scourge of their foes. Norsca is a savage and brutal land, plagued by lethal winters for more than half the year, and worse, lashed perpetually by raging gales of Chaos energies howling down from the ancient ruins of the fallen Warp Gate resting at the very heart of the northern Chaos Wastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
chaosdwarf_government;Sorcerous Conclave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaosdwarf_government_desc;The Chaos Dwarfs are ruled by the tyrannical Sorcerer-Prophets of Hashut, who assert their rule through fear and magical might granted to them by the Bullfather. Not all Chaos Dwarf rulers are Sorcerer-Prophets though, and indeed, most are petty warlords and slavemasters known as Despots or Overlords. Despite not being Sorcerer-Prophets, Chaos Dwarf custom still dictates that they must govern from the Ziggurat-Temples of Hashut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaosdwarf_guilds_government;Dawi-Zharr Slaver Guild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaosdwarf_guilds_government_desc;The Chaos Dwarfs consider all life other than that of their own kind to have value only as raw resource and fitting sacrifice, and to them the muscle and sinew, and even the souls of those that bow and scrape at a gesture of their iron-shod hands and cringe before the stroke of their steel-barbed whips are no more than a commodity to be amassed, exploited and spent. Without slaves Zharr-Naggrund would not have been built and its vast industries could not be maintained, and even now, the need for fresh-blood and labour only increases with each passing year and the desolate empire always hungers for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
