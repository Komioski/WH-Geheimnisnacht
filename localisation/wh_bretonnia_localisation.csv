#
EVTDESC_bretonnia_400;We have come across an unusual story. Sheep and peasants have gone missing, and despite repeated punishments the shepherds insist that they are not lacking in their duties. They claim a foul beast, as tall as a house and reeking like a tannery lurks in the hills, periodically emerging to devour whatever it can catch. After some conference with your retainers you determine it could very well be a troll! Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.6.b;No, I seek greater glories than mere trolls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.4;You have quested for a long time now, perhaps it is time to return home and see to your responsibilities there?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.7.b;No, wait... what if there is a dragon over there instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.7;After a week of searching, you finally come upon some troll tracks which lead to a dark cave which emanates horrendous smells and sounds. It seems there are more than one after all. Girding yourself as best as you are able, you light some torches and prepare to destroy this threat to the local community.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.8.a;I dedicate this victory to the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.8;Your band marches into the troll lair, and though they are strong and ferocious opponents they are no match for your superior knightly valour. Swords cut them to pieces, torches and oil cauterise their wounds, and faith wreathes you like an unbreakable barrier. After slaying half a dozen of them, you take a moment to rest and examine the lair. Though trolls are usually far too stupid to gather treasure and are more likely to simply eat it, for whatever reason these ones had a small pile of loot. Perhaps it was dessert?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.9.a;Men, advance in the other direction - quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.9;Your band marches into the troll lair, full of pride and zeal, but quickly find yourselves in trouble! Six trolls loom out of the darkness like living nightmares, snatching your retainers up into their maws and ignoring the few wounds you manage to inflict. You are hard pressed to make it back to the exit alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.10.b;No, a mere mob of orcs is an unworthy foe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.10;You hear rumours that an orc warband is raiding this area. Do you want to investigate?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.11.a;I hope there's enough for all of us! Onward to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.11.b; No, wait. I think I see a giant over there, this way men!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.11;After some hard riding you find the trail of destruction left behind and quickly catch up to the orcs. The greenskins seem to be meandering across the countryside, looting and burning at random according to the whims of a larger-looking boss. It's only a small war party of less than two-score orcs with a mob of lesser attendant greenskins, but your band of faithful are but a handful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.12.a;For the Lady! Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.12;The orcs are too unprepared to do more than turn and roar defiance as your band approaches, and you smash into them with your fellow knights in a glorious charge. With lance and sword you drive a deep wedge into their hastily formed ranks. The orcs fight poorly and the boss only slightly more challenging, your lance taking it in the throat before you crush it into the mud. The assorted goblins and snotlings that were following the mob attempt to scatter, with most of them ridden down with ease. It is a righteous slaughter, and their kind will now know the folly of trespassing in these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.13.a;Men, advance backwards! Double quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.13;As soon as you begin to charge the orcs, the boss in control of the mob spots you, shouting and beating his underlings into crude ranks to take the impact. Some of them brace with great shields and pikes, and as your charge is broken you find yourself being attacked from all directions!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.14;As you travel along the coast you spot a sleek black ship moored in the shallow water. On the beach nearby is a dark elf raiding party, and they have captured a number of humans! Surely taken in lightning-quick raids on nearby farms and villages, they are preparing them for transport back to their terrible slave-markets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_bretonnia_406;The peasants are not my concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.15;Your mighty charge takes the foul slavers completely by surprise, and rather than form a line and try to repel you, they make a mad dash for their ships. You slay many of the cowardly elves, and free the captives. The surviving raiders make it back to their vessel and flee, but after taking such losses and failing to carry cargo they are unlikely to return any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.16.a;Arghh, men *cough* advance... backwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.16.b;A true knight never turns from danger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.16;The dark elves have sharp eyes that saw you coming from afar, and quickly form disciplined ranks with tall shields and cruel-looking blades at the ready. Worse still, as you approach the taste of foul magic suffuses the air. An unnaturally pale, lithe sorceress pushes her way to the front of the line, leering at you while performing an arcane ritual, and suddenly the air around you explodes with thunder! When you come to a moment later you realise you've been thrown from your horse and are smoking slightly!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.17.a;Forwards! To victory! For the Lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.17;A surge of righteous anger fills you and you leap back up on your horse, spit the blood from your mouth, couch your lance, and with a great battle cry you charge the foul sorceress and her cohorts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.18;The Sorceress casts another spell at you, but as her lightning bolt fails to stop you, she turns and runs and the rest follow. You slaughter many of them as they flee for their ship, and free the captives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.19;You rush the dark elves, but the sorceress merely grins wickedly and hurls another spell at you. Lightning arcs out from her hands once more and strikes you, and you feel excruciating pain as you are once again blasted from your horse. This battle is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBRETONNIA.23.b;I'm all alone, no one will know if I just ride away...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBRETONNIA.23;You know you are not the bravest of knights, but you do try your best. On a solitary ride through the countryside you come across one of your men-at-arms, his weapon sundered, his shield split and his chest carved open. He manages to gasp out an account between fits of coughing, and before he passes you eventually discern that a Norscan berserker had wandered out of the wilderness, raving and cursing in a crude language and slaughtering anyone he sees. He has already slain twenty good men single-handedly, and judging by the screams just over the hill, he's not far off...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
